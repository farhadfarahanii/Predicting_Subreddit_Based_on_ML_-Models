320,AccomplishedWindow49,"**problem** apple watch refuses to charge while showing charging cable icon along with red/green lightning bolt, like in the picture below. &amp;#x200b; [this is the reason why you are here \\](https://preview.redd.it/9p1e7rn9x8wa1.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=efb0ecfc2168be54bbfc8106d9a866d2b000ea25) **cause of the problem** the above image indicates that the apple watch's battery has been depleted to point where it can't boot anymore or even keep time. the following might be the reason why it happened to you. **watch inactive for long time:** even when the device shuts down, the internal battery still has enough charge to keep the current time and date. however, if the device isn‚Äôt charged, the battery will continue to deplete to level that requires an initial charge before it can power up the device. **prolonged exposure to the sun:** the apple watch might have been exposed to the sun for prolonged period of time. this could have caused the battery to overheat to such an extent that it‚Äôs not able to take the charge anymore. **brand new watch:** the apple watch is brand new, and the battery is completely dead because it‚Äôs been in the store for long time until you purchased it. **potential solutions** **force restart:** you can force restart the apple watch by pressing the digital crown and the side button for at least 10 seconds until the apple logo appears. **use higher wattage charging brick:** try using charging brick with higher wattage. usually, all apple watches use only the wattage they need. most generations of watches will never use more than couple of watts, no matter how much wattage the charging brick has to offer. even the series and 8, which have fast charging, don't need brick with more than 20w. onefruit did an experiment where they measured the ampere the watch was taking in, and it peaked at *0.36 amperes* *(roughly watts, considering the output voltage of 5.5 volts)*, but in our case, the watch has depleted the battery and needs an extra boost. any charging brick with wattage above 60 would be good. ***personal recommendation:*** borrow macbook charger or oneplus supervooc charging brick (80 watts) and charge your watch. personally find them pretty effective. **hours of charging:** i'm pretty sure you would have tried this already, but charging the watch for 6+ hours may bring it back to life. **super discharging the watch:** this time, try the opposite of the previous point, deplete the apple watch battery all the way until pressing the buttons doesn't show the green charging cable snake. once the watch reaches that point, plugging it into the magsafe charger should reset the battery and charge it. video explaining in detail **tip:** press the buttons so that they turn the display on. this will accelerate the battery depletion process. **use new version charging cable (applicable only for s7/s8):** fast charging, introduced on s7 apple watches, requires newer version of the charging cable. this cable has aluminium around the magnetic charger and usb-c connector. using an older version of the charging cable could be the problem. *edits and suggestions are always appreciated. wrote this because don't want another person to panic search the internet like did. hope it works for you. cheers -* ***kart*** list of solutions for apple watch red snake of death (charging cable icon with lightning bolt)",AppleWatch,543

591,sathomasga,"disclaimer: want to be very clear from the start, this post is my own personal opinion. other folks will certainly have different opinions, and that‚Äôs fine. promise not to disparage those who feel differently about what ultra band works best for them. also promise to ignore anyone who claims to know better about what ultra band works best for me (though am open to suggestions for alternatives to my current choices). note: none of the links in this post are affiliate links. all of the items mentioned were purchased by me at full price. ## background: why wear an ultra for me, the apple watch ultra is mostly for workouts: running, cycling, and swimming. really do race and train for ultra-marathons, ironman triathlons, and 100+ mile bike rides. for those activities the extra battery life and the action button make the ultra significantly better than standard series 8. indeed, consider the upgrades available in the ultra essential. but that does mean that i‚Äôm not normally wearing the ultra for daily activities. most of the time you‚Äôll find mechanical watch on my wrist. this preference affects my priorities when selecting watch band for the ultra: 1. comfort. above all else, the band must be comfortable. the last thing want to worry about hours into trail run is some annoying irritation on my wrist. at that point in the workout i‚Äôve got plenty of other discomforts begging for attention. 2. snug fit. to get the most accurate heart rate readings from the ultra‚Äôs sensor, the watch should be snug against your wrist. you don‚Äôt want any external light leaking in between your wrist and the watch, and you definitely don‚Äôt want the watch bouncing around on your wrist. 3. aesthetics. this is the lowest priority; don‚Äôt usually look that great during workouts anyway. but it‚Äôs not insignificant. may be wearing the watch while traveling to and from race, and occassionally wear the ultra at other times. so, as long as it doesn‚Äôt compromise comfort and fit, good looking band is desirable. ## apple‚Äôs ultra bands the obvious starting place for an ultra band are those offered by apple itself. for me, however, all of apple‚Äôs options leave something to be desired. here‚Äôs what bugs me about each one. ## alpine loop the alpine loop seems like the perfect band for the ultra. it looks great, iconic even (especially in orange). lots of folks love the alpine loop. hate it. for me, the alpine loop completely fails the comfort requirement. the problem is the strap‚Äôs edge. it‚Äôs thin, and it‚Äôs also fairly rigid, particularly when the band is taut on the wrist. https://preview.redd.it/efvd7o2ylhva1.jpg?width=1616&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1bd732033c9e72ac676aa50cae43405d6807d2d7 if i‚Äôm wearing the alpine loop tight enough to keep the watch snug, the band‚Äôs edge is invariably digging into my wrist. https://preview.redd.it/tj7r0461mhva1.jpg?width=2513&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=761064cfa3389ebb17c2f3340e20ed93b9006603 this might be tolerable for short period of time, but in longer workouts it becomes literally painful. the alpine loop is hard no. ## trail loop the trail loop is the most comfortable hook-and-loop strap i‚Äôve ever used on any watch. by far. the fabric has wonderful premium feel, and it‚Äôs super soft against the wrist, even at the band‚Äôs edges. the band is also infinitely adjustable, making it easy to get perfect fit. should like this band. *want* to like this band. but just don‚Äôt. suppose it comes down to aesthetics. to me, velcro strap looks cheap, even premium velcro strap from apple. and yes know, that luxury brands like omega sell velcro straps (for [$210](https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/omega-two-piece-strap-2-piece-grey-speedmaster-moonwatch-velcror-strap-032cwz016040w) no less). but, to prove my point, that‚Äôs one of the least expensive straps that omega offers. most of omega‚Äôs straps sell for several times more, and some cost [over thousand dollars](https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/omega-two-piece-strap-black-alligator-leather-strap-98000014w). functionally, the trail loop is great, but in my subjective opinion its aesthetics let it down. ## ocean band the ocean band is my favorite of apple‚Äôs own selections. in fact, it‚Äôs my band of choice for swim workouts since it doesn‚Äôt retain mosture lke fabric straps. just wipe it off, shake out the drops from the inside tubular ribs, and you‚Äôre good to go. the fluroelastomer rubber is super soft and feels great against the wrist (and it‚Äôs far more durable than the cheap silicone knockoffs available on amazon and ebay). the band is stretchy enough to allow great fit, and think it looks fine, at least for dive watch. but also think rubber straps look little out of place on regular watches, especially in the winter. if forced to live with this band, i‚Äôd be okay with it. but maybe we can do better. ## third party bands to me, the apple watch ultra exemplfies what watch enthusiasts call ‚Äútool watch.‚Äù it‚Äôs not watch designed to look pretty, rather it‚Äôs watch intended for specific purpose. that‚Äôs not to say that tool watches can‚Äôt look nice; don‚Äôt think too many folks consider the [rolex submariner](https://www.rolex.com/en-us/watches/submariner) ugly. but the watch‚Äôs functionality takes precedence. historically, tool watches are often worn on some type of fabric strap, even by fashion conscious folks like [james](https://grail-watch.com/2018/04/19/the-real-james-bond-watch-strap-resurrected/) [bond](https://www.thejamesbonddossier.com/films/spectre/the-james-bond-watch-strap-from-spectre.htm). fabric straps can be rugged, water-resistant, and attractive, which means that they can pair perfectly with the ultra. finding the right type can be tricky, however. standard [nato straps](https://www.gearpatrol.com/watches/a85507/nato-strap-history/) don‚Äôt work on the ultra. those straps pass through both watch lugs and sit between the watch case and the wrist. on an apple watch they would block the heart rate sensor. two-piece variants are available, but the nicer ones usually have fine weave with little flexibility, making it hard to get perfect fit. better option is the [marine nationale](https://www.fratellowatches.com/ndc-straps-the-story-behind-the-original-marine-nationale-parachute-elastic-strap/) style. this type of band uses elastic (originally from parachute straps) and has infinite adjustability, making it easy to dial in the fit. and, having been invented in the 1970s by the french navy‚Äôs combat dive team, it‚Äôs hard to argue with their durability and utility. several brands sell marine nationale straps pre-configured for apple watches. that includes both of the brands that i‚Äôm going to recommend. however, do ***not*** recommend simply buying the apple watch version of their straps. quality strap makers, especially those selling niche styles such as marine nationale, cater to luxury watch owners and watch enthusiasts. they may not have as much experience with the apple watch, and, sadly, their apple watch products tend to be standard watch straps with random apple watch adapters thrown on. as you‚Äôll see, i‚Äôm *very* picky about apple watch adapters. in fact, think the apple watch adapter is the crucial part of great apple watch ultra band. that‚Äôs how start assembling the ultimate ultra band, and think there are two different approaches. ## option 1: most reliable the ultra is, of course, apple‚Äôs most rugged and durable apple watch. it makes sense to match that durability with highly reliable band, and the most reliable connection for band is fixed lug apple watch adapter. these adapters are made from single piece of metal; they have no fasteners that can inadvertently unfasten, no screws or springs that can rust, and indeed they are pretty much indestructable. https://preview.redd.it/j2x4uwx5mhva1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1285e620f5c193920bdb9766b9ce40fa852b4d62 when looking for fixed lug adapter, have yet to find any specifically made for the ultra that can recommend. unfortunately, all of those seem to be sized for straps that are 26mm or even 28mm wide, and that‚Äôs too wide for my taste. for reference, measure apple‚Äôs alpine loop to the 25.5mm wide, the trail loop to be 25mm wide, and the ocean band to be 22mm wide. to me 22mm is the ideal strap width, while 24mm is acceptable. fortunately, adapters made for 42/44/45mm apple watches are usually sized for 24mm width straps. it is true that those adapters do not perfectly align with the ultra‚Äôs case shape. the difference, however, is very small. the case overlap is hidden by the strap, and the adapter‚Äôs opening is large enough to avoid any excessive compression of the strap. (these statements are not true of spring bar adapters discussed in the next section.) my most recent source for these adapters is [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1253735860/all-series-solid-metal-connectors-for), though you can find them in other online marketplaces. another mismatch you may find with these adapters is the finish. the ultra is bead-blasted titanium, while adapters are stainless steel, usually polished. addressing this mismatch requires nothing but bucket of sand and small automotive funnel. simply pour sand through the funnel onto the adapter. five to ten streams from height of couple of feet are usually enough to turn polished steel into close facsimile of the ultra‚Äôs titanium. the following photo shows the results of this technique. the adapter on the left is polished; the one in the center has been subjected to the sand bath, and the one on the right is from apple‚Äôs alpine loop for comparison. https://preview.redd.it/r89gumx7mhva1.jpg?width=2941&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12f32ac6df405fc956c15110a13bfe5340dae204 as for the strap to install on these adapters, my choice is the [hook strap fbv3 pro](https://nickmankeydesigns.com/shop/hook-strap-fbv3-pro-stainless-steel-elastic-watch-band) from nick mankey designs. this is solid, durable strap with especially strong stitching. the elastic is firm enough to keep the watch securely hugging your wrist, but plenty soft enough for comfort. the hardware is 316l stainless steel and it‚Äôs both trivial to fasten and appropriately difficult to unfasten. select blasted silver finish to perfectly match the ultra. nick‚Äôs straps have always been very popular in the watch community, as evidenced by the 10-week backlog on orders. the product is worth the wait, though. https://preview.redd.it/en9aprt9mhva1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c67d4205f5223c987beb856ae0bf5bc27d6067b &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/4x62lzcbmhva1.jpg?width=1672&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8346ead98607094732c62a5f2326b66792849965 ## option 2: more styles the pro straps from nick mankey designs are currently limited to five solid colors. if none of those styles are attractive to you, there‚Äôs another way to create the ultimate ultra band. instead of using fixed lug adapters, you can use apple watch spring bar adapters. these adapters let you install straps with standard spring bars on an apple watch. unlike fixed bar adapters, do recommend seeking out spring bar adapters designed specifically for the ultra. you can see the difference in the following photo. the standard version on the left is perfectly straight between the lugs. the ultra version, on the right, has curvature that perfectly matches the ultra‚Äôs case. https://preview.redd.it/mv6rt2oemhva1.jpg?width=1666&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44d7edd40fcc707c936d54f49638f48c98268173 the next two photos show what they look like when installed in the ultra. https://preview.redd.it/bp52y4tgmhva1.jpg?width=1413&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=74de53b3dc2fec42357cc650c093bcf81bc54221 &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/miofj78imhva1.jpg?width=1111&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e72b096d6980948e3bba2d271f90e281622a3c91 with the standard adapter, the strap is compressed between the spring bar and the case. as you can see, that‚Äôs smaller than the space between the spring bar and the adapter, putting extra pressure on both the strap and the adapter. that pressure can prevent the strap from sliding freely, and it can push the adapter out of the case, creating an unsightly gap. ultra-specific spring bar adapters are just now coming on the market. my recent purchase was from [ali express](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804837648631.html), but hopefully they‚Äôll show up on ebay and amazon soon. as with the fixed lug adapters, you may have to use the sand-and-funnel technique to match the ultra‚Äôs finish. one thing won‚Äôt use from ali express spring bar adapters is the spring bars themselves. they‚Äôre often nickle-plated instead of stainless steel and are thus subject to rust. they‚Äôre also less robust and have shorter pivots that fit into the lugs. instead, use quality, swiss-made stainless steel spring bars such as those from [otto frei](https://www.ofrei.com/page1750.html#34945). the difference is apparent in the photo below. the quality bars on the right are thicker (1.8mm vs. 1.4mm) and the pivot is long enough to securely engage with the lugs in the adapter. https://preview.redd.it/l8w1yb5kmhva1.jpg?width=940&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6583a177c44ead94353e57045df6bb52e289a84f in fact, if your adapters are thin enough, the pivots from the bars may be too long, as in the photo below. if this happens, place the spring bar in pin vise and use hand file to trim the pivots down just enough to prevent any protrubence. https://preview.redd.it/vifoab5mmhva1.jpg?width=852&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eeebae82db624948c2fbae8aed8a0593bcca4b1d think the best strap to install on spring bar adapters is from [erika‚Äôs originals](https://erikasoriginals.com/mn-straps/apple-watch.php). it‚Äôs even more durable than the nick mankey strap, and it‚Äôs equally as comfortable and secure fitting on the wrist. as you can see from the link, there are large number of styles and colors from which to choose. there are even options to customize it further. as you may notice, the link provided is to the apple watch version of the mn strap. if you order that version, it will come with screw-on apple watch adapters. do not recommend those adapters, as the screws they use are not stainless steel; they will rust when exposed to water or sweat. instead place custom order and request the apple watch version of the strap but without any apple watch adapters. when i‚Äôve done that, they‚Äôve deducted the cost of the adapters from the order, so it saves both money and the trouble of removing their adapters. do not order the standard (non-apple watch) mn strap, that strap is intended to pass through both lugs like standard nato strap, and it will not work with an apple watch. happen to think the corsa orange is just about the perfect strap for the ultra, especially if you prefer the standard wayfarer watch face. https://preview.redd.it/4hzy8wbomhva1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa9d9555456b6652326b2a6a96a9cdce2c957629 &amp;#x200b;

(that said, it still screws up basic instructions on my phone so we‚Äôll see.) the variety of faces and complications is great, if sometimes frustrating (see below). it‚Äôs nice just to have different colour and shape on my wrist. the bad not only does the apple watch app on ios still seem half-finished, it‚Äôs actually gotten *worse*. designing face like is tedious slog through endless lists of ‚Äúwell that looks ok‚Äù faces that can then muck around with. even more than that, it‚Äôs impossible to tell, for instance, which faces allow which complications without clicking through. or which colours affect the whole face vs affecting just the dial and hands. sometimes you even have to change the dial shape to accommodate complications. but there‚Äôs no way to know this except tapping around. the watch itself still feels to me largely without much function. maybe i‚Äôm just getting old, but all my old watch really did in the end was tell the time and look cool. this one does the same, but slightly cooler and it also can store and play podcasts. maybe i‚Äôll find more stuff to do with it (or actually manage to work out for more than couple of days in row), but for now it‚Äôs mostly timepiece. i‚Äôd buy an analogue watch, but find that bit *too* non-functional. feel like the marketing was bit misleading on the always-on display. went looking to see if the se had one and the website said something along the lines of ‚Äúall apple watch models from series on, including the apple watch ultra.‚Äù missed the asterisk that added, ‚Äúbut not the se‚Äù underneath the paragraph. in short: i‚Äôm pleased with it overall, but it‚Äôs never going to be an essential device for me. i‚Äôm likely going to be staying on the extremely slow upgrade cycle i‚Äôve established. so see you in 2030 guess. upgraded from first-generation apple watch to second-generation se",AppleWatch,443

829,idontliekpoetry,"hi all, just bought the apple watch se 2022 gps cellular for myself as an early birthday present. it‚Äôs been less than three hours since i‚Äôve received it in the mail and already want to return it. bought the cellular version (which is more expensive) specifically so could listen to spotify with my airpods without having to have my iphone near me. not only can‚Äôt stream music from spotify on my apple watch without my iphone nearby, but i‚Äôve had to buy spotify premium so could listen to music on more than one device. turns out that can only listen to music that i‚Äôve downloaded, which in my opinion completely fucking defeats the purpose of having bought the cellular version. minus the music frustration, i‚Äôve found that the apple watch is quite useless at anything else other than what wanted for: fitness tracking and music. however, returning it would be pain as it is not feasible for me to go to post office, so my only option would be to physically go to an apple store. i‚Äôve also ordered some accessories (bands, screen protector) online, which would also have to go through the pain of returning. the added cost to my data plan is also making me want to bash my head into wall. to be fair, it has only been three hours, so i‚Äôm not sure if should wait couple days to see if i‚Äôm going to end up liking it or if i‚Äôm doing the whole spotify thing wrong. so here lies my dilemma and the cause for me ranting to bunch of strangers on reddit: should return it or stick with it? should return my apple watch?",AppleWatch,280

1793,MartinIsland,"bought my first smart band in 2019. it was xiaomi mi band which got for about $20. this cheap band (which probably told some shady corporate men everything about me) had sleep tracking. loved that feature, it was what used the most. sure, it wasn't perfectly accurate, but it was accurate enough for one key thing: telling me how many hours of sleep got. you see, suck at sleeping. never remember at what time fell asleep, so if wake up after am and don't feel tired, i'll just start my day. and then i'll feel tired few hours later, when it's too late to go back to sleep. that's where that cheap band really shined. if woke up at any time could just look at the band and see how much sleep had so far. if it was under hours, back to sleep. the set up was also pretty simple. you put on the band and... that's really it. no focus modes, no tapping any buttons. the band figured out had fallen asleep all by itself. amusingly, it would even notice was taking nap, and register it as nap. fast forward few years. i'm no longer broke and treat myself with an apple watch 7. knew apple had taken long time to add the feature and know they usually do this because they want to get it right. love that ""don't be the first, be the best"" philosophy and was so disappointed when found out they weren't either in this case. if i'm going to sleep earlier than my schedule the watch won't realize i'm sleeping unless miraculously remember to tell my watch i'm sleeping. if wake up before the alarm (which almost always do), the watch doesn't know i'm awake and, what's worse, it won't even tell me how many hours of sleep got so far to decide if need to keep sleeping or not. well, not always, anyway. if the watch is in good mood, i'll get that ""looks like you're awake. start your day?"" pop up when turn off sleep mode. if don't get that mesage, have to wait until my sleep schedule decides i'm awake. naps don't exist. sleep tracking is important. it's important for my amazingly fragile mental stability, and it's important for everyone. it's one of the few cases where technology is actually useful for consumers (contrary to features that marketing makes us think are necessary). with wwdc coming soon, hope we get to see apple agreeing with this. sleep tracking is years behind the ($25 price tag) competition",AppleWatch,425

(cue massive eye roll.) am admittedly not the most tech-savvy millenial, but come on y'all- its absolutely ridiculous that the devices have to have service with the same provider for all the functionality of the watch/phone pairing to actually work. do any of you have any work arounds/solutions to my problem? any suggestions/advice completely welcome, cause otherwise--- have mini cellphone on my wrist that tells me the time, and while do want that feature, want it to route to my already established/existing phone line! lmao. &amp;#x200b; thank you in advance for any tips! iphone &amp; watch on different service providers",AppleWatch,267

(i hate this so much). comparing the watches have to admit the apple watch ultra is just better despite the shorter battery life. i'm dude who likes nice watches but cringe when think might become one of the ""idiots"" if pick this up. mean honestly i'm not diver, do hike with my dog but i'm not foresr ranger who goes on 20k hikes. like the look of apple watch ultra, the screen is really stunning and the display looks more vivid than the galaxy watch pro 5. it's gorgeous watch. can afford it, but my mind still recoiles at that price. plus i'll have to buy damn apple phone to even use it!!! my wrist feels barren and don't like it. rip my beautiful galaxy watch. why oh why did you have to die? i'm sure i'm gonna hear alot of comments from ppl who are solely team apple. i'm just not that ""guy"" the brand simply doesn't matter to me. love functionality and look. this damn watch has me on the hook. i'm really trying to justify the price of the apple watch ultra.",AppleWatch,362

3395,Manwelio,"look, apple, for all your quality, what the hell is wrong with this issue? people have been complaining about this for years now and this still isn't resolved? put fucking manual data push option in the sleep settings so the watch can push it's data to the health app manually when the bogus automation doesn't work. for those who don't know, when you have sleep mode on tracking your ""time in bed"" and an alarm set, if for any reason at all you need to default to using the phone to turn off the alarm and ""wake up,"" you will lose your sleep data for the night. you have to accept the alarm from the watch. and worse, there is no way to push the watch's data manually to the app later. now apparently the way around this bullshit is to not use the alarm setting. you're supposed to wait for the watch to determine that you are now awake and it's time to get up. but again, you need the watch to say you are awake. if you turn off sleep mode on the phone, no data. and in my experience, the watch takes very long time to figure out that you're actually up and awake. don't want to have to do jumping jacks and go out my building to get the watch to recognize i'm not lying still in bed. so the solve, in my mind, is that if your watch drops battery in the night, there is data from part of the night. why can't we get that? if you accidentally accept the alarm on the phone or change your sleep mode on the phone, there is data on the watch from your night of sleep. why can't we manually push that? why is this such simple issue that hasn't been fixed for years? pissed off at sleep mode",AppleWatch,312

448,Inside-Woodpecker127,"hello all! have been struggling with the galaxy watch pro to work with my very, very tattooed arms and have been experimenting with different solutions. firstly, where the watch is on my arm is straight black ink, so if this works in my case it will work in any case. secondly, this jury rigged fix is just so the watch will register that it's being worn and thus you can receive notifications on use nfc, etc. this will not help you if you're looking to take advantage of the health data. had read about using epoxy stickers and whatnot but it didn't work for me, plus it was questionable as to whether they work with the charger or not. also, they aren't readily available nearby (for me at least). my solution: take piece of plastic wrap (aka saran wrap, cling film, etc.) and fold it into square that covers the sensor at the center of the backside of the watch. it should probably be about 2-3 layers/folds thick. then take one or two pieces of scotch tape and fasten the plastic wrap to the back of the watch, covering the sensor. you can make it thin enough to trick the sensor while also being able to charge the watch and wear it without even noticing it. if you're curious as to how/why this works recommend this video: https://youtu.be/azj-hm6f-mi keep in mind the ultimate goal is to fool the sensor, which is reading reflected infrared not flesh tones necessarily (hence why band-aids are tricky to work with.) so there you go. there's my thesis. now all this being said, it's super fucking stupid on samsung's part that there isn't software workaround to at least allow notifications to come through despite not being able to use the health features. this is stupid modification to have to make in order to use the base features. ultimate tattoo sensor failure solution (for now)",GalaxyWatch,319

812,glenner05,"this has bothered me since long time, on several wear os watches. problem is the following: have currently samsung fold and samsung watch pro lte (but i've had the problem on other devices too in the past, al wear os devices). when the watch is connected through bluetooth there is not single issue. if have my phone on the table for several hours, while not touching it, all notifications are instantly pushed to the watch, no delays. however, when leave my phone at home and going out with my watch only, it will correctly switch over to lte connection and there the problems start. when my phone is recently used (few minutes ago) the watch can establish remote connection. at that moment al notifications are pushed to the watch, almost no delays. however, after while, usually within 30 60 minutes the notifications start to be delayed, and even the remote connection just stops (seeing the disconnected symbol on the watch). also sending messages or replying them on the watch is instantly and correct at first, but starts to fail after while. **it seems like the google cloud sync service is killed after while on the phone, preventing the forwarding of phone notifications to the watch over lte (cloud sync)**. tried everyting on my samsung phone, changing the battery optimizations of all samsung wearable apps and plugins, google apps, play service etc... turned of as many battery saving features could find on my phone, but no luck. if leave the phone on the charger, the cloud sync keeps working for longer time, but agian, ofter some time it will slow down, starting with unablity to reply or send messages from the watch, to complete disconnection... al this while the internet connections on the phone and watch are rock stable... firmware versions and play services on phone and watch are up to date. tried factory resets as well... has anybody any clue why this happens?? is there some trick or setting overlooked? does anybody know which app or service on the phone (samsung) is responsible for this google cloud sync? again, this is not only on this phone-watch combo, had several wear os watches from different brands in the past, but mostly samsung flagship phones. cant believe that two samsung devices are not software optimized so these issues cant happen... always bought lte watches so could go for run or go to the gym phone free, is brilliant when it works, but very annoying when it usualy is not reliable.... i'm thinking even to switch to the apple camp, hoping those issues are not present on apple watch cellular... but like samsung devices more then iphone .... samsung watch google cloud sync issues on lte",GalaxyWatch,453

818,jayfiled,"took bit of fiddling around and looking through forums but added an e-sim from woolworths mobile on my watch even through my phone was with [circles.life](https://circles.life). my issue was that even though managed to add the esim from different carrier through the galaxy wearable app, in the **watch settings** \&gt; **mobile plans** the galaxy wearable app will have it turned off and tell you ""your phone and watch need to be on the same carrier"" if you try to turn it on. **tl;dr**. once you've added the esim, you can't turn it on from the galaxy watch app on the phone, but you can turn it on from *the watch's* settings. connections &gt; mobile networks &gt; mobile plans. \------------------- my situation and how to: my phone plan is with [circles.life](https://circles.life) and just signed up with woolies mobile long expiry 65 day plan (as test/gamble) with esim. i'm guessing you can do it with any provider that offers qr code to add your esim to the device. i've added the esim through the galaxy wearable app and now have the ability to call and use data from my watch. it has it's own cellular plan with it's own phone number, but it works just fine. if your phone and watch don't have bluetooth connection but your phone has internet, it will push notifications to the watch over the internet and your watch will receive them via lte. you can respond to those notifications, use sms and make calls. you have the option to use your phone's profile in each case (if the phone has an internet connection). woolies send you the qr code (and the unique qr code id in case the qr code doesn't work) via email within minutes of singing up and also manual code. so, to get it to work: 1. first, on the galaxy wearable phone app main screen &gt; left upper corner, click the three slashes &gt; about galaxy wearable &gt; tap the title **galaxy wearable** times &gt; this opens hidden settings menu &gt; tap test e-sim feature &gt; qr test mode on 2. go back to the watch's main settings screen and choose **watch settings** \&gt; **mobile networks** \&gt; **add mobile plan** then because you turned on the qr test mode, you should see an option to add an esim via qr code. 3. scan the qr code and follow the steps to add your esim. side note here: tried copy/pasting the code id instead of using my camera, but didn't get button show up to add it, so went back and used the camera. only had my watch and phone, so screen-shotted the qr code from my email on my phone, then sent it to my watch, then scanned the qr code shown on my watch with my phone. 4. once your esim is added, you can't turn it on from the galaxy watch app on the phone, but you can turn it on from within **the watch's settings**. 5. on the watch, go to settings &gt; connections &gt; mobile networks &gt; mobile plans, press the toggle to turn on. that did it for me. how to use an esim from different carrier on your phone and watch. galaxy watch pro (aus use case)",GalaxyWatch,540

1586,dovla19,"was wondering what's the general consensus on the gw5 pro as sports watch on this subreddit, and wanted to hear your thought guys. my personal opinion is that there's huge room for improvement, specially software, here my top list. getting gps fix when starting any activity (though health) that requires gps signal (such as running, cycling etc.) the watch lets you start the activity right away even without gps signal. sometimes if you're in an area with not lot of sky visibility (since it does not have dual frequency gps antennas) it takes the watch couple of minutes to acquire the signal. it would be so much better if before starting the workout the watch goes in mode of ""getting gps fix"" similar to the strava app, of like on the garmin watches. workout screens almost all activities outside of the typical ones (running, cycling, swimming, hiking etc.) show you were little data on the screen during the workout. the workout screens are basically duration, calories and heart rate, for activities such as skiing, snowboarding it would be useful to have info on total distance covered, average/current/max speed, total vertical descent etc. on the other side for indoor activities such as push-up or any type of weight machines it would be useful to have the number of reps counted as it should not be difficult for the watch to track it. indoor activities if you do treadmill runs, exercise bike or similar workouts, you should be able to adjust the pace/speed or distance achieved to much the actual activity performed. for example would run 5k on treadmill and put pace of 5min/km but the watch doesn't know that, so it assumes the pace and distance covered based on the number of steps done, and the assumed length of your stride and you end up sometimes with half km of difference. activity readiness since the watch has your historic activity data and can track your sleep, spo2, vo2 max etc. it could give you ""activity readiness"" for the day info, wit score for the date, or body battery info, similar to the info garmin watches are able to give you. routes the routes options integrated into the gw5 pro is pretty neat but gives you the options to the follow them just though cycling and hiking, and lacks the same option for i.e. running (if you're doing trail running that option would be quite handy). galaxy watch pro as sports watch",GalaxyWatch,410

1606,sonicintrusion,"tldr: you can remove bunch of apps from the watch but keep the google assistant working. debloating saves bunch of battery power so find it really useful to do. originally followed few online posts and found big long list of things to remove from the watch that aren't required for normal 'watch' functionality. but something on the list was breaking the google assistant it just wouldn't load anymore. after months of putting up with broken app, decided to investigate and after several resets and app reinstalls found specific list of apps that could remove and still keep the assistant working. \&gt; watch setup (this may or may not be useful but it'll get you to the same place got to): 1. after the normal setup of samsung galaxy wearable app on the phone with the watch setup with samsung and google accounts. 2. enable wifi to help with the speed of the install process you don't really need it at this point but you'll need wifi later for the de-bloat process anyway. 3. install the google assistant app. (at this time also install all the other google suite of apps for. convenience, such as: wallet, keep, gboard, clock.) 4. open the google assistant from the app tray on the watch and follow normal login and setup process. 5. you can test it but giving it an instruction. if it says ""how can help?"" then it's working. you can set up the button to answer to assistant at this point if you want. \&gt; disable/uninstall unwanted apps from the watch's app tray or the wear app. any app you can uninstall here won't affect assistant. examples: messaging (com.google.android.apps.messaging) maps (com.google.android.apps.maps) \&gt; uninstall any watchfaces from the wear app: any watchface you can remove here won't affect assistant. example: samsung global goals at this point you need to get the adb access to the watch. hopefully you can find guide elsewhere to help if these instructions aren't clear enough \&gt; enable adb debugging over wifi on your watch: 1. settings &gt; about watch &gt; software info &gt; software version (tap until you get the developer mode) 2. settings &gt; developer options &gt; adb debugging (enable) 3. settings &gt; developer options &gt; debug over wifi 1. if wifi isn't enabled then go do that now and come back 2. take note of the ip address in the setting. it will look like this: ""192.168.0.101:5555"" \&gt; access the adb shell on your computer: 1. install android tools. for macs: `brew install android-platform-tools` 2. connect your terminal to your watch: `adb connect` [`192.168.0.101:5555`](https://192.168.0.101:5555) 3. authorise your connection on your watch. selecting ""always authorise"" will simplify the process. 4. check the terminal is connected: `adb devices` 5. open shell: `adb shell` at this point you can initiate commands to the watch. follow the sections you want below: \&gt;

1975,Awkward-Pick4117,"ok, this may take some time, but here are the basic steps. feel free to dm me if you have any questions. 1. make sure your watch is in debugging mode. if it isn't, go to settings/about watch/software info look for software version when you find it, tap it times to unlock developer options. get back to the settings main page and select the developer options at the bottom of the page. scroll down to adb options and enable it. also, enable adb over wifi. when you do that, an ip address should pop up. that's your watches ip address. (ex. 192.60.x.xx) write it down. 2. download easy fire tools from the play store. this will allow you to sideload the tone selector app to your watch. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.agondev.easyfiretools 3. download the apk for tone selector from here. don't install it. just download the apk to your phone. https://m.apkpure.com/tone-selector-ringtone-alarm/com.tone.selector/download the apk link is down toward the bottom. it's 1.9mb. now open easy fire tools (eft) on your phone, make sure your watch is close, and both are connected to the same wifi network. in the top left corner of eft, click the bars and then click settings. go down to ip address, then type in the ip address of your watch you wrote down earlier. once you hit ok in the top right of the screen, you will see plug looking icon. click it, and it will attempt to connect to your watch. you will have to click ""ok"" on your watch to allow the connection. (make sure the adb over wifi on your watch is turned on, like explained earlier) the plug turns green, think, to show it's connected. once you're ""connected"" to your watch, you'll see two options at the top of the eft screen. ""installed apps and ""custom apk"" click on ""custom apk"" and then search in your phone for the tone selector apk you downloaded earlier. click it, install it, and after few minutes, it should install directly onto your watch. then all you have to do is open the tone selector app on your watch (it has little ts symbol) to use the ts app. open it on your watch. press and hold whatever you want to change. ringtone, notification or alarm, and then follow the prompts to the desired music file you want. use the gear wearable app to load music onto the watch like normal and use the tone selector app to set them as ringtones or whatever. note: when your watch dies or is shut off, sometimes the ringtones will go back to stock sounds. no worries, just open ts, press and hold ringtones, and then just re-select the ringtone you want. you'll get so used to it that can do it in less than seconds now. hope this helps. any questions you can dm me or message me here. fix for custom ringtones on watch",GalaxyWatch,483

1979,doom1282,so about month ago my watch 40mm started rebooting when charging and showing an error message. took it into samsung and got the motherboard replaced and week later it started doing the same exact thing. plan on taking it back to the samsung store next week while the repair and watch are still under warranty but figured it was lost cause and got watch pro. think my watch crapped out because of my job. work with marine animals and sometimes it gets splashed but never dunked into tank and always lightly rinsed and dried with fresh water and the water eject feature is used. it lasted almost year of constant abuse so guess it's all can expect. obviously these watches are not designed for saltwater use but know several people using galaxy and apple watches at my job and they haven't had any issues. obviously it's massive size increase. the screen size is nice but damn is it bulky. bulkier than my ticwatch e3 which now have in rotation because i'm clearly too hard on my watches. grabbed samsung case for it but can't find any water resistant cases which seems to be available for apple watches (sucks that samsung gets shafted for third party accessories.) so far the battery life and performance blows my watch out of the water even though the specs are very similar. the original watch strap sucks though. it's not very intuitive and lacks the ease of traditional strap. overall it's nice upgrade but i'm wary of it lasting more than year. i'd like to see samsung watch that can handle deep saltwater use like the apple watch ultra but this seems like my best bet for now. hopefully this watch can live up to the pro name. upgraded to watch pro,GalaxyWatch,297

(samsung e-mail even does not show the ""delete"" option) \- app drawer who invented this terrible menu with bubble icons without description on gw4 think totally don't like the oneui implementation over stock wearos ui. if only they would allow to switch between them... \- thought it was not possible to have google wallet configured on the watch without pin this morning my gw4 did not ask me for pin after put it on my wrist. checked google wallet then, and it started without problem. \- last night was almost asleep, but then got 3-4 notifications from apps on the phone. interesting, because my gw4 was in the ""sleep mode"" and definitely showing ""dnd"" icon. think i'll put the gw4 in drawer for some time and see if it gets better after some more updates, because for now it's not offering me much improvements over hw2 (and hw2 has twice the battery life...) p.s. gw4 loses about 11-12% overnight with sleep monitoring, hw2 only 4-5%. gw4 is offering ecg and body composition features, but these are the only features that keep me from selling it, really. galaxy watch no automatic sleep detection with dnd mode no way to delete e-mails from the notification",GalaxyWatch,359

2276,Alcoholfreeliketwice,"so i‚Äôve decided i‚Äôm gonna get the s23 ultra in couple months (when my contract period is up). feel like want more in my phone than iphone can give me, and have decided to do the jump after lots of research. however that also means i‚Äôll have to let go of my apple watch, as it‚Äôs not compatible with any other brand. really like my apple watch honestly, and i‚Äôm kind of nervous about that change. it‚Äôs not that use it for anything very apple specific, aside from using siri, but know galaxy watches also have voice assistant, so it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to get used to. but what i‚Äôm nervous about is if it‚Äôll feel like downgrade. now hear me out before you fly into an apple hateful rage, am not an android/samsung hater in the slightest, and will explain exactly why have this fear. so, the current watch have is an apple watch se. it was released in 2020 and was basically an entry level watch compared to their mainline watch apple watch released on the same exact day. one month ago thought i‚Äôd try to get galaxy watch to get feel for it and be prepared for the phone switch. because the galaxy watch is the latest watch that also work on iphone, and it was released just month before the apple watch se that has worked perfectly for me this far, thought it would be good fit. bought used one (which my se was too) and paired it to my iphone. now of course didn‚Äôt expect every function to be available when not using galaxy device (i did my research) but was honestly so disappointed. it was incredibly slow, it struggled to do most things properly. apps refusing to update, bixby rarely working, apps not starting‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm quite big into tech overall. the first thing did was to try and update the watch. it took many tries before it finally updated. but despite updating and restarting, the problems didn‚Äôt get better. one of my main usages of the apple watch is using siri to set timers. it‚Äôs super convenient to just say ‚Äúhey siri, set 10 minute timer‚Äù or hold down the button and say ‚Äúset 10 minute timer‚Äù. the fact that bixby barely wanted to work at all made me unable to use this watch. went back to my apple watch very quickly as needed that function to work. also was disappointed in the vibration as it was very weak despite being on the higher setting use my watch as an alarm in the morning and don‚Äôt think that low vibration would do much. so that‚Äôs what has me worried. if my entry level apple watch works so much better than the main series galaxy watch (from my experience), will the newest galaxy watch even be an upgrade? has your galaxy watch been working without issues? did just happen to get really bad watch? maybe it was used more intensely than my se? (which only had for like half year and also bought used). is the watch prone to issues? again know it‚Äôs not optimal with an iphone, but these don‚Äôt sound like issues caused by my phone brand not matching, but rather the watch having issues in itself. even more interested to hear from others who went the same route from apple to samsung. again i‚Äôm truly not trying to shit on samsung as whole, know the phones are pretty darn amazing, and really want to do the jump. just need to get this cleared up. getting the new phone and then getting watch that doesn‚Äôt do what need it to do but being unable to use the previous one due to the phone not matching would be catastrophic. regarding my upcoming change from apple to samsung my experience with galaxy watch",GalaxyWatch,639

2348,Gadgety1,"wondering why received this recommendation to reset my watch, checked my phone. discovered that the galaxy wearable app had reinstalled on the phone. that must have happened today as earlier reordered the tiles through the galaxy wearable app. with the new installation of the galaxy wearable app, all watch setting on the on the phone are now gone. the phone cannot reconnect, although the watch is visible, and the galaxy wearable app claims my watch is connected to another phone. assume this ""another phone"" is the same phone but with different installation of the galaxy wearable app. samsung phone support believes ""your watch has connected to some other phone, perhaps your neighbor's..."" right, how would that have happened? don't believe it for second and there hasn't been any indication of such anywhere. meanwhile the watch is connected to google keep via lte, which tested by entering new google keep note on the watch and it was viewable both on pc and phone very soon thereafter. the phone part of the lte watch works, but none of messaging functions, logged into the samsung account to check my watch status from my pc, and the samsung site claims my watch has been disconnected since week, on the same day installed samsung pay. i've been using the watch everyday, all samsung apps have been working, such as samsung health which has been receiving all my activities until yesterday, i've paid with the watch, used public transport etc. would like to salvage my watch's settings because it took lot of time and effort to get google assistant and google keep to work. the google assistant is not available from the play store when accessing from the phone and samsung's support had to provide major support for couple of hours to get it working. now don't want to lose it. the samsung account does not show any back up of the watch whatsoever, albeit thought this would be taken care of. the last samsung support rep had contact with told me there never is any back up made of the watch settings. that seems odd. their representatives seem to have extremely varied experience from non-existent to very knowledgeable. so, some questions: 1. is there anyway to salvage my watch settings through activating developer settings and somehow make back up of the watch settings to my pc? or is the procedure to simply give up and reset the watch and look forward to major effort of trying to get the google assistant up and running again. 2. is there way to prevent this from happening again. believe had set the watch to only update manually, but it's running gwa3 whereas the last time looked believe it was running gvk1. 3. galaxy wearable was set to quite lot of interventions and updating must have been on automatic. will try to set this to only update manually in the future. 4. samsung's rep could not tell me how my watch was changed from active to inactive in the samsung cloud settings. find it extremely annoying because there has been no sign that this happened, no message on either phone or watch that this took place. so it could happen again, and would only find out if continuously log into the samsung account and have look. any way to set up message when there is change in status for devices. btw samsung could not tell by why there is not ""reactivate"" function in the samsung online account. the lack of information and knowledge is pretty scary. this afternoon got message on the lte watch to reset it if want to connect to the phone. any way to salvage the watch settings by activating the developer settings?",GalaxyWatch,617

(like why does the dnd widget in the quick panel not let you choose 1, 2, forever hours like it does in the tizen os version? where did the barometric pressure graph go? etc.) does samsung have any method for users to support bug tickets other than screaming into the void? hopefully if anyone else has seen this weirdness, this helps explain what weird behavior you were probably seeing. galaxy watch wearos contact bug workaround",GalaxyWatch,258

3024,SonicPhoenix,"thought might share something discovered recently after few months of frustration with both problems. noticed that my watch 44mm non-lte would sometimes last for two plus days between charges but sometimes run down in less than day. battery consumption was incredibly inconsistent, losing only 1-2%% per hour then draining 10% in 30 minutes without any change in usage. i've also been having trouble with my galaxy s22 video and audio sporadically stuttering across multiple apps. &amp;#x200b; two entirely separate problems that are both well documented among users right? turns out, at least in my case, they were linked. noticed that sometimes when tried to change the media volume on my phone, instead of increasing or decreasing by one notch per click, it would change unpredictably, increasing few notches then decreasing few notches on single button press as if child were playing with volume dial. eventually noticed that this volume behavior was linked to the video stuttering. originally would have to reboot my phone to fix the problem but eventually determined that toggling airplane mode also solved the issue and eventually narrowed it down to toggling the bluetooth. toggling the bluetooth got me thinking so the next time noticed that the watch battery was draining rapidly, checked my phone and the erratic volume along with video stuttering was present. toggled the bluetooth on the phone and everything, including batter consumption went back to normal. &amp;#x200b; know this doesn't solve the problem entirely but with little extra awareness, this has turned problem that nearly had me return the watch into something that is manageable with minor annoyance. additionally, if samsung happens to check this sub, maybe this information can help them resolve the battery drain issue many of us are seeing. reported this to samsung via their website but have no idea if it will get to the right people or if it vanishes into the void. &amp;#x200b; so if you've been having either, or both, of these problems and none of the fixes from other googled threads are working, try toggling the bluetooth and see if it helps. tale of two problems watch battery drain and s22 video stuttering",GalaxyWatch,358

(also, this is probably unlikely, but have hunch): this almost seems like (nyquist) sampling problem! if finish my exercise, obviously expect my heart rate to drop. but, it actually rises! this sounds as if the tracker cannot correctly sample 175-180, and is erratically reporting it as 130; but when my heart rate drops, it now gets back into the ""acceptable"" range, and hence the watch suddenly starts reporting it correctly. gw4: erratic pulse rate on random days",GalaxyWatch,182
