I saw there have been some posts about this, but I thought that maybe someone has some updated information on this.

As the title says - how does the Galaxy Watch 5 40mm compare to the 44mm battery wise?

Did anyone do an actual comparion? 

I currently have the 44mm but I feel like it's just a little bit too big for my wrist, so I consider getting the 40mm, but I am afraid of the smaller battery.Galaxy Watch 5 Battery Life 40mm vs 44mm",0,GalaxyWatch

14,MasterWaxOff,I just bought the Galaxy Watch 5Pro for $449.39. What in the fuck are they thinking for not including a charger? This is just ridiculous to me. The same thing happened when I bought my fold 4. Samsung needs to be held to a higher standard.

My steps are tracked, and if I reach my target I get the notification no problem.  However, for whatever reason, if I look at my previous days steps (almost all of them) from the calendar view it will display that my goal was 6000.  If I had say 6500 steps on that day, I can see that the app retroactively gave me credit for reaching my goals even if I did not.  Almost all previous days show that my goal for that day was 6000 except for the odd one that is correct at 8000.  I have no idea what could be causing this.

I go to bed with a watch charge of about 60%. About 5 hours later, the watch battery is empty and needs to be fully charged.

I happened to wake up overnight and found the watch at 4% power. I checked which app had used the battery, but only the apps I'd used the previous day were claiming to have used up the original 40%.

The only thing I do with the watch at night is put it into sleep mode so it doesn't shine brightly.  I don't have snore detection on. 

The battery usage during the day seems pretty good actually. It's just this mysterious drop overnight like it quickly skips from 55% power to 4% power.

It looks like Samsung is not selling the same charger that is supplied with the watch separately.

There's a lot of cheap noname aftermarket chargers that cost $10-15, but the reviews are not promising either - I see many complains about them being unreliable, slow, overheating the watch etc. More reputable brands like Anker or Belkin don't seem to be making any chargers that are compatible with Samsung watches, despite selling many different chargers for Apple watch.

167,AnonyM0mmy,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to decide where to go next in my watch journey. Started with Fitbit but after those crapping out every 1-2 years I decided to try Garmin. I have the Venu 2 and it's starting to show its age a bit, so I'm looking at mixing it up. I love having details on health stats (like sleep, O2, heart rate, calories, etc) but I get absolutely no use out of any of Garmin misc. sports oriented features. I don't care really about tracking the actual paths of my runs or whatever. So with that in mind (and also having a Galaxy phone) I thought it'd make more sense to get more functionality out of my watch that I'd actually use (like text integration and such) compared to paying premium prices for an admittedly sturdier watch filled with things I don't care about.

This brings me to my comparison research of the classic 4 versus the 5. I've always been interested in the mechanical bezel of the classic 4 because it looks nice and has a useful functionality, but I'm worried about if that feature is prone to issues like longevity or mechanical issues over time. That being said, if it is an issue, and the 5 has substantial improvements on how it tracks health stats like calories and sleep, then I could suck it up and get the 5. And honestly I don't really care about battery life that much since I can just charge it every day I take it off to shower.

So what is everyone's opinions on this? Is the 5 a meaningful upgrade over the Classic 4? Are either a good alternative to Garmin options?Is the Rotating Bezel worth it or is it a gimmicky detriment?",0,GalaxyWatch

However, when I have seen which apps drain more battery the first one is always Google Assistant that drains more than 50% of the battery. It is very odd because I use rarely this app. So I am thinking to uninstall this app and to use as assistant only Bixby that,I have to say, is not too bad if you use Samsung Buds or Watches. What do you think about that? How can I unistall Google Assistant from my watch?

181,DethBringa,"Just got a GW5 Pro and thought I'd have a play with WFS so I can have everything matching. After a day of learning things I hit a wall where I couldn't find the info on complications I was after. I thought the best way would be to just take a best guess approach and just test the face and see. Here's where the problem happened.  


Attempt 1 (WIFI):  
I followed the instructions on connecting my watch to the PC WFS for testing. Enabled dev mode, turn on ADB and wifi debugging, hit the button in WFS. WFS couldn't see my watch. I tried multiple times turning all the settings off and on again and going through the steps 1 by 1 and double checking what I was reading. I tried manually adding IP address as well.  


Attempt 2 (Bluetooth):  
After giving up I went through the instructions for instead using my phone (S23 Ultra) connected to my PC via USB cable, connect to GW5 with bluetooth to the phone. Seemed easy enough until I hit the issue of turning on bluetooth debugging on my phone. I looked everywhere for it, it doesn't exist. I could see my phone in WFS but not my watch. Once again checked settings everywhere, dev options and in the Wear app too.  


Attempt 3 (APK Build):  
Third attempt was to just ""build"" the face and load it manually. It gave me 2 files APK and AAB, I put them in a shared folder and installed the APK on my phone through the network. After a couple of security warning popups it finished and it didn't do anything that I can see. I tried copying both the files onto my phone and reinstalling the APK. Still no luck.  


So, after trying 3 different ways I'm lost as to what to try next. There's no point spending more time on building my custom watch face if it's not even possible to use it.

212,Awkward-Pick4117,"OK, this may take some time, but here are the basic steps. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions. 

1. Make sure your watch is in debugging mode. If it isn't, go to SETTINGS/ABOUT WATCH/SOFTWARE INFO
    Look for SOFTWARE VERSION - when you find it, tap it 7 times to unlock developer options. 
     get back to the SETTINGS main page and select the¬†Developer options¬†at the bottom of the page. Scroll down to ADB options and enable it. Also, enable ADB over WiFi. When you do that, an IP address should pop up. That's your watches IP address. (Ex. 192.60.X.XX)  write it down. 

2. Download EASY FIRE TOOLS from the Play Store. This will allow you to sideload the TONE SELECTOR app to your watch.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.agondev.easyfiretools

3. Download the APK for TONE SELECTOR from here. Don't install it. Just download the APK to your phone. 

https://m.apkpure.com/tone-selector-ringtone-alarm/com.tone.selector/download

The apk link is down toward the bottom. It's 1.9MB.

Now open EASY FIRE TOOLS (EFT) on your phone,  make sure your watch is close, and both are connected to the same WiFi network. 

In the top left corner of EFT, click the 3 bars and then click settings. Go down to IP address,  then type in the IP address of your watch you wrote down earlier. Once you hit ok in the top right of the screen, you will see a plug looking icon. Click it, and it will attempt to connect to your watch. You will have to click ""ok"" on your watch to allow the connection. (Make sure the ADB over WiFi on your watch is turned on, like I explained earlier)   The plug turns green, I think, to show it's connected. 
     
Once you're ""connected"" to your watch, you'll see two options at the top of the EFT screen. ""Installed apps and ""custom apk""  

Click on ""custom apk"" and then search in your phone for the TONE SELECTOR apk you downloaded earlier. Click it, install it, and after a few minutes, it should install directly onto your watch.  Then all you have to do is open the TONE SELECTOR APP on your watch (it has a little TS symbol)

To use the TS app. Open it on your watch. Press and hold whatever you want to change. Ringtone, notification or alarm, and then follow the prompts to the desired music file you want. Use the Gear Wearable app to load music onto the watch like normal and use the TONE SELECTOR APP to set them as ringtones or whatever. 

NOTE:  When your watch dies or is shut off, sometimes the ringtones will go back to stock sounds. No worries, just open TS, press and hold ringtones, and then just re-select the ringtone you want. You'll get so used to it that I can do it in less than 5 seconds now. 

Hope this helps. Any questions you can DM me or message me here.Fix for Custom Ringtones on Watch 5",0,GalaxyWatch

So I've seen a few posts around here from people who can't change to custom notification and ring tone sounds anymore. I just got a gw5 and first thing I wanted to do was replace my notification sound to a star trek sound, but couldn't do it. 

I did some digging and found the following post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/10jcgbx/tool_allinone_tool_for_windows_wear_os_tools_v80/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button

It basically is a tool for windows that changes the ringtone and the notification sound for you on any wearOS device without any hassle! Literally no need to write long sentences of code. It's a user interface that helps you do it all the way. 

You need the ADB toolkit for windows
Activate ADB debugging on watch
The tool created by /u/bernarbernuli

It took me less then 5 minutes to change it. 
Please check it out and follow the steps. It works! But I do expect that after a reboot you loose the custom sound (as others have posted). I haven't restarted or rebooted yet so idk.

216,doom1282,"So about a month ago my Watch 4 40mm started rebooting when charging and showing an error message. Took it into Samsung and got the motherboard replaced and a week later it started doing the same exact thing. I plan on taking it back to the Samsung store next week while the repair and watch are still under warranty but I figured it was a lost cause and got a Watch 5 Pro. 

I think my Watch 4 crapped out because of my job. I work with marine animals and sometimes it gets splashed but never dunked into a tank and always lightly rinsed and dried with fresh water and the water eject feature is used. It lasted almost a year of constant abuse so I guess it's all I can expect. Obviously these watches are not designed for saltwater use but I know several people using Galaxy and Apple watches at my job and they haven't had any issues. 

Obviously it's a massive size increase. The screen size is nice but damn is it bulky. Bulkier than my TicWatch E3 which I now I have in rotation because I'm clearly too hard on my watches. I grabbed a Samsung case for it but I can't find any water resistant cases which seems to be available for Apple Watches (sucks that Samsung gets shafted for third party accessories.) So far the battery life and performance blows my Watch 4 out of the water even though the specs are very similar. The original watch strap sucks though. It's not very intuitive and lacks the ease of a traditional strap. 

Overall it's a nice upgrade but I'm wary of it lasting more than a year. I'd like to see a Samsung watch that can handle deep saltwater use like the Apple Watch Ultra but this seems like my best bet for now. Hopefully this watch can live up to the Pro name.Upgraded to Watch 5 Pro",0,GalaxyWatch

Hi everyone,

So  I was looking for a wireless charger for both my Galaxy Watch 5 and my  S21 FE. I also have the Galaxy Buds Live and the Galaxy Buds2. I came  across the Trio Wireless Charger (see link below), but it only says it's  compatible with Galaxy Watch Active, GW2 and GW3. However, it's a  product from 3 years ago I think, and also the listings of phones stops  at the Note 20 series.

So maybe  the listing with compatible devices is just outdated and the GW Active,  GW2 and GW3 are just indications for only ""Samsungs watches""? Because I  don't believe the S21 series can't charge but the Note 20 series can.

Thanks  in advance if you let me know :). I found a good deal (only 62 euros)  for this and it comes with cable and adapter included so I really hope  it'll be compatible.

232,7484815926263,"So I have a weird issue. I have long covid and I got the GW5 to monitor mainly my HR and sleep. A big long covid problem for a lot of people including myself is a shooting heart rate when you stand up (POTS). I've noticed that the GW5 is basically useless for seeing these sudden spikes because the HR reading will just blink for literal minutes until the heart rate stabilizes? At least that's my explanation. It never shows my values right after I stand up which is exactly what I need it to show me. Readings I got from the regular tracking went right up to around 120. 

Then I noticed the ""workout"" mode is much more responsive and does not have the blinking problem. But ever since I started turning ""other workout"" on before I stand up and move around the house it's been going as high as 157, with regular readings in the 140-150 range, which would be a \~70BPM jump from just sitting down. It usually shows some time after I do some very light activities and it's quick to go back down, but I'm wondering if this is accurate or somehow giving me false info. I don't feel my heart thumping out of my chest during these readings, I actually feel pretty normal all things considered. When I manually measure by pressing my wrist and counting for 15sec I usually get around 110-120, but I've never counted a 150+.

238,groovygorons,"I have a GW Active 2 and have used it for many years with no issues. However, in the past few months I've noticed this bug and I haven't been able to determine why it's happening or how to fix it.

Basically, the time displayed on my watch is always accurate. And when my watch auto-records a workout, it's also accurate to the current time. But, when I manually record any workout, the time displayed on my watch during that workout will be 6 hours into the future. This will happen for the entire duration of the workout and as soon as I stop tracking it, the time is correct on my watch again.

It's a small detail, but it's frustrating as the Samsung Health app also shows the inaccurate times for when I did the workout, so it will say that I worked out at 1am the next day which skews my daily exercise data. It's also frustrating because when I'm manually recording a workout I can't see what the actual time is.

Does anyone know how to fix this? I've combed through all of the settings on my watch and on the Health app and can't seem to find anything that would solve this issue. And I can't figure out why it would only be happening when I'm manually tracking my workouts.Manually recorded workouts display time 6 hours in the future?",0,GalaxyWatch

246,TalkToDaHand,"Hi there. Been using Galaxy Watch 4 for a half a year now, lately some GPS issues have atarted to appear. First of all, Strava app gets stuck on fixing GPS screen endlessly, as I have seen lots of other people also posted this and it's a common Watch issue. However, as I can see Samsung Health can't fix on location either. I have downloaded GPS fix app (cant remember the exact name) that helps fitness apps such as Google fit and Strava to fix on satelites, but it could not get signal either. Another issue that is linked to this is that Samsung health does not sync to Strava, but as others explained it's due to fact that it only syncs data with GPS data as well.

If anyone knows what to do a tthis point please help, I have enabled all the permissions for everything possible, reset my watch and pretty much done anything.

Or.. the longer route and issue here:

 

I have two watches that i have to switch back and forth on, im trying to use one destination app and sync all the data on steps to that app.. it doesnt work it seems

I tried health sync, you cant sync both samsung health + fitbit steps as the source to a destination.. nor can you choose a different destination that is samsung health. Out of the currently installed destinations only google fit is the option.

Im getting the sense there is no way to combine these watches steps into one single app and at this point i dont care which app. Id even be fine if i could send samsung health data to fitbit as well. Or if the samsung watch would send steps directly to a different app?

328,danievdm,"Wondered if anyone else this issue, as I logged it with Samsung but they promptly closed the ticket (will unrelated auto-response mail). After complaining, they suggest a hardware evaluation, but I think it is software.

**Problem:**

I start an elliptical training exercise, but the heart rate shows same start rate for a good 5 or 10 mins, then shoots up to my actual rate of 155 or higher (image with 20 Feb 2023 date on). Yesterday I tested it against the sensor on my elliptical machine and it confirmed 168 bpm whilst the Samsung Watch showed 120 bpm. Then after a while it shot up to the correct reading for the rest of the exercise.

Mostly what I've been noticing is, it rises a bit after the start of the exercise, then there is no reading for 5 or 10 minutes, then it is suddenly back for rest of the exercise at correct heart rate (image with 6 Feb 2023 date on).

It seems more noticeable since the software update.

**What I've done:**

1. Wear watch an extra notch tighter during exercise.
2. Tried pausing / restarting exercise.
3. Have latest OS on watch, phone and Samsung Health app.
4. Rebooted watch.
5. Watch was also completely reset last week after I got a new phone.

Any suggestions would be welcome. But I'm wondering if anyone also has this pattern?

373,sullf,"Motion is looking to offer something which will make your galaxy watch more fun and engaging when using it to get active.

If you are still wondering, what can Motion do for me? I will explain it quickly!

**Data-based personalised goals-** Each user will receive a personalised weekly goal in the form of one simple score.  
Upon sign-up, Motion analyses your recent activity data to find what you complete in an average week. From this, our algorithm calculates a weekly goal which will cause you to improve against your average levels of activity.

**Compatibility-** I know many of you will have friends with Apple watches, Garmins etc so we made Motion compatible with any smartwatch and available on IOS or Android  
You can connect with these friends through:  
\- Simply adding friends to see their activity in the feed  
\- Creating teams to challenge or work towards a goal together

**Activatars-** I know some are a fan of the Samsung health badges which can be earned, but to improve this further we have added your own Activity Avatar (Activatar). These have the ability to be levelled up through you hitting your goal and will show emotion during the week depending on whether you are on track.

You might be thinking what‚Äôs the catch? How is it free?

To be transparent, although V1 was successful we are still a relatively new startup and are just trying to grow our user base and provide value before thinking of monetising.

383,xfire74,"So, switching form my WaerOS based Huawei Watch 2 I was expecting some kind of big tech quantum leap. I am using GW4 for some time now, and here are some of my observations :

\- Huawei Watch 2 has this cool automatic sleep detection, with the possibility that it can automatically set itself to DnD mode, switch off cell network radio etc. - all this to allow me to sleep without any disturbances. It works even for a short nap, and it's surprisingly reliable. I can't see anything similar on my Watch 4 - I think it's not possible ?

\- E-mails - on HW2 it was possible to tap ""delete"" under e-mail notification (I am using FairEmail application) and the unwanted e-mail was deleted. Check mark appears, and it's gone. On GW4 it does not delete the unwanted e-mail, but it's also showing me to ""Continue on the phone"" - but there's nothing to continue. I've tried also Outlook and native Samsung e-mail - none is working as I need. (Samsung e-mail even does not show the ""Delete"" option)

\- App drawer - who invented this terrible menu with bubble icons without description on GW4 ? I think I totally don't like the OneUI implementation over stock WearOS UI. If only they would allow to switch between them...

\- I thought it was not possible to have Google Wallet configured on the watch without PIN ? This morning my GW4 did not ask me for PIN after I put it on my wrist. I checked Google Wallet then, and it started without problem.

\- Last night I was almost asleep, but then I got 3-4 notifications from apps on the phone. Interesting, because my GW4 was in the ""Sleep mode"" and definitely showing ""DnD"" icon.

I think I'll put the GW4 in drawer for some time and see if it gets better after some more updates, because for now it's not offering me much improvements over HW2 (and HW2 has twice the battery life...)

P.S. GW4 loses about 11-12% overnight with sleep monitoring, HW2 only 4-5%.

2. In the results, there is an entry for Universal Gestures

513,Alcoholfreeliketwice,"So I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm gonna get the s23 ultra in a couple months (when my contract period is up). I feel like I want more in my phone than iPhone can give me, and have decided to do the jump after lots of research. However that also means I‚Äôll have to let go of my Apple Watch, as it‚Äôs not compatible with any other brand. I really like my Apple Watch honestly, and I‚Äôm kind of nervous about that change. It‚Äôs not that I use it for anything very Apple specific, aside from using Siri, but I know galaxy watches also have voice assistant, so it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to get used to. But what I‚Äôm nervous about is if it‚Äôll feel like a downgrade. Now hear me out before you fly into an Apple hateful rage, i am not an android/Samsung hater in the slightest, and I will explain exactly why I have this fear.

So, the current watch I have is an Apple Watch SE. It was released in 2020 and was basically an entry level watch compared to their mainline watch Apple Watch 6 released on the same exact day.
One month ago I thought I‚Äôd try to get a galaxy watch to get a feel for it and be prepared for the phone switch. Because the galaxy watch 3 is the latest watch that also work on iPhone, AND it was released just a month before the Apple Watch SE that has worked perfectly for me this far, I thought it would be a good fit. I bought a used one (which my SE was too) and paired it to my iPhone. Now of course I didn‚Äôt expect every function to be available when not using a galaxy device (I did my research) but I was honestly so disappointed. 
It was incredibly slow, it struggled to do most things properly. Apps refusing to update, bixby rarely working, apps not starting‚Ä¶ 
I‚Äôm quite big into tech overall. The first thing I did was to try and update the watch. It took many tries before it finally updated. But despite updating and restarting, the problems didn‚Äôt get better.

One of my main usages of the Apple Watch is using Siri to set timers. It‚Äôs super convenient to just say ‚Äúhey siri, set a 10 minute timer‚Äù or hold down the button and say ‚Äúset a 10 minute timer‚Äù. The fact that bixby barely wanted to work at all made me unable to use this watch. I went back to my Apple Watch very quickly as I needed that function to work. I also was disappointed in the vibration as it was very weak despite being on the higher setting - I use my watch as an alarm in the morning and I don‚Äôt think that low vibration would do much.

So that‚Äôs what has me worried. If my entry level Apple Watch works so much better than the main series galaxy watch (from my experience), will the newest galaxy watch even be an upgrade? Has your galaxy watch been working without issues? Did I just happen to get a really bad watch? Maybe it was used more intensely than my SE? (Which I only had for like half a year and also bought used). Is the watch 3 prone to issues? Again I know it‚Äôs not optimal with an iPhone, but these don‚Äôt sound like issues caused by my phone brand not matching, but rather the watch having issues in itself.
Even more interested to hear from others who went the same route from Apple to Samsung.

Again I‚Äôm truly not trying to shit on Samsung as a whole, I know the phones are pretty darn amazing, and I really want to do the jump. I just need to get this cleared up. Getting the new phone and then getting a watch that doesn‚Äôt do what I need it to do but being unable to use the previous one due to the phone not matching would be catastrophic.Regarding my upcoming change from Apple to Samsung + My experience with galaxy watch 3",0,GalaxyWatch

517,MagicCarptRide,"Composing on my phone; thanks in advance for any suggestions.

The past couple of weeks, my Galaxy Watch4 (SM-R870) has not been accurately tracking the amount of time I've actually been sleeping. 

In hopes it would improve the accuracy, I started activating Sleep Mode when I go to bed, to no avail. I also confirm that my watch is not loose in order to ensure accurate data measurements.

The best example I can give is from last night:
9:30 PM - Laid down in bed and activated Sleep Mode
10:00 PM - I'm asleep
5:50 AM - Wake up (naturally) before my 6:00 AM Alarm

I slept approximately 8 hours.

My watch indicates I slept from 1:20 - 5:50 AM... a total of 4.5 hours.

When I got my watch at Christmas, it measured my sleeping time pretty accurately.

My galaxy watch 2 used to be able to accurately track my mileage and speed but now it's all over the place. I just finished running a course that I know is 4.2 miles and it only tracked at 3.8. That's nearly half a mile short!


What's more is that the distance tracking is way off. Usually the first mile is slow by as much as 1-2 minutes.


Also, buttons are just not as responsive as they once were. Severe lag is becoming a common occurrence and exercise tracking sometimes just stops midway through a workout for no reason.

533,ari_wonders,"I've read a lot of opinions on this sub on how not accurate the GW sensors are - and from my years of experience having Samsung wearables, those claims are absolutely accurate. They're not good. It's difficult to believe a company like Samsung can't match the likes of Huawei or even Apple on that, but it is what it is. But here's a solution I found for that.

For me, I like to use the watch for NFC payments, notifications and other goodies the watch does provide though. But I'd really like to know when I actually fall asleep for instance (the Huawei GT 3 does that beautifully and incredibly accurate), and of course, REM, light, deep sleep due to my medical condition (a good sleep is really important for me to track) but, the Huawei watch doesn't do NFC payment in my region. Bummer! The GW4 does it and I use it a lot! For that I love my GW4 Classic. But for the fitness/health tracking, we can always wear a RING! That's right! üòÅ Oura Ring, for one I've seen, does all the tracking for health and fitness incredibly well. So I'm considering getting one of those for that - it's absolutely less intrusive when in sleep than wearing a big 46mm watch, and it'll do far better than the watch has been trying to do for years. For everything else the watch will do!

 It's sad to look for an alternative out there for something that we're already paying for - this watch is supposed to do that, but if you're like me that won't use an iPhone, I think that can be an even better deal. Thought I'd share an alternative, that's all. Roast me away...Sensors are not good - here's a 'third party' solution for that... lol",0,GalaxyWatch

I hoped an official solution would come out, but I don't think an official app is coming and got sick of waiting, so I looked into it more today; I now have a working version of fb messenger on my Galaxy Watch 4. Though you can find other posts about this if you look around, I didn't find a post dedicated to it, so I thought I'd share here.

This is done with a process called ""sideloading."" This just means we're manually installing APKs that aren't available in the Play Store.

[Initial setup](https://www.droidwin.com/how-to-install-facebook-in-galaxy-watch-4/). Do all of Step 1 and skip the first part of Step 2 for now, i.e., do all of Step 2 except for 2.1. The key here is to enable debugging mode on your watch and install [Easy Fire Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.agondev.easyfiretools&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) on your phone.

Next, we need a version of facebook messenger that isn't problematic, i.e., the field to type messages is clickable. Through a combination of trial &amp; error and suggestions I saw on another post, I opted for [Version 18, nodpi](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/facebook-2/messenger-lite/messenger-lite-318-0-0-7-105-release/facebook-messenger-lite-318-0-0-7-105-6-android-apk-download/).

Now that you have Version 18 of Messenger Lite installed on your phone, go back to Step 2 and use that in place of the Facebook Lite APK file.

After waiting for the install to finish (be careful not to touch other areas of the screen during installation or it will cancel), open your watch and check that it's there. Now sign in and you're good! Note: the text field is tiny and requires some precision to open the composition screen, but it doesn't take long to get the hang of it.

This solution is far from perfect, but I'm very happy to finally have fb messenger on my watch in a useable state since it's my main method of communication with friends and family. I hope it helped you too!!PSA: How to install facebook messenger on your Galaxy Watch 4 or 5",0,GalaxyWatch

However I really wanted to have full LTE functionality (voice + data) on my watch.

Also this will only work in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step-by-step instruction**:

1. set-up an account at Tello (my referral link is at the bottom of the post - and thanks if you choose to use it!), configure your plan (mine is $7 per month) and buy the eSIM
2. on your phone go to Galaxy Wearable app and access hidden menu: tap  the ""3-stripe"" menu on the upper left -&gt; tap gear icon on the right -&gt; tap ""About Galaxy Wearable"" -&gt; tap quickly 5 times on the big title ""Galaxy Wearable""
3. in that menu tap ""Test ESIM Feature"", then turn ON the ""Current QR TestMode""
4. Go back to the main screen, tap ""Watch settings"" -&gt; ""Mobile plans"" -&gt; tap ""Use code"" and scan the QR code you got from Tello in step (1)
5. On your watch go to Settings -&gt; Connections -&gt; ""Mobile networks"" and ensure either ""Auto"" or ""Always on"" is chosen, then scroll down to the ""Mobile plans"" and switch ""Tello"" to ON

585,Gadgety1,"Wondering why I received this recommendation to reset my watch, I checked my phone. I discovered that the Galaxy Wearable App had reinstalled on the phone. That must have happened today as I earlier reordered the tiles through the Galaxy Wearable app. 

With the new installation of the Galaxy Wearable app, all watch setting on the on the phone are now gone. The phone cannot reconnect, although the watch is visible,  and the Galaxy Wearable app claims my watch is connected to another phone. I assume this ""another phone"" is the same phone but with a different installation of the Galaxy Wearable app. Samsung phone support believes ""your watch has connected to some other phone, perhaps your neighbor's..."" Right, how would that have happened?  I don't believe it for a second and there hasn't been any indication of such anywhere.

Meanwhile the watch is connected to Google Keep via LTE, which I tested by entering a new Google Keep note on the watch and it was viewable both on PC and phone very soon thereafter. The phone part of the LTE watch works, but none of messaging functions, 

I logged into the Samsung Account to check my watch status from my PC, and the Samsung site claims my watch has been disconnected since week, on the same day I installed Samsung Pay. I've been using the watch everyday, all Samsung apps have been working, such as Samsung Health which has been receiving all my activities until yesterday, I've paid with the watch, used public transport etc.

I would like to salvage my watch's settings because it took a lot of time and effort to get Google Assistant and Google Keep to work. The Google assistant is not available from the Play store when accessing from the phone and Samsung's support had to provide major support for a couple of hours to get it working. Now I don't want to lose it. The Samsung account does not show any back up of the watch whatsoever, albeit I thought this would be taken care of. The last Samsung support rep I had contact with told me there never is any back up made of the watch settings. That seems odd. Their representatives seem to have extremely varied experience from non-existent to very knowledgeable.

So, some questions:

1. Is there anyway to salvage my watch settings through activating developer settings and somehow make a back up of the watch settings to my PC? Or is the procedure to simply give up and reset the watch and look forward to major effort of trying to get the Google Assistant up and running again.
2. Is there a way to prevent this from happening again. I believe I had set the watch to only update manually, but it's running GWA3 whereas the last time I looked I believe it was running GVK1.
3. Galaxy Wearable was set to quite a lot of interventions and updating must have been on automatic. I will try to set this to only update manually in the future.
4. Samsung's rep could not tell me how my watch was changed from active to inactive in the Samsung Cloud settings. I find it extremely annoying because there has been no sign that this happened, no message on either phone or watch that this took place. So it could happen again, and I would only find out if I continuously log into the Samsung account and have a look. Any way to set up a message when there is a change in status for devices. BTW Samsung could not tell by why there is not ""reactivate"" function in the Samsung online account. The lack of information and knowledge is pretty scary.This afternoon I got a message on the LTE watch to reset it if I want to connect to the phone.

599,el2025,"Hello there

I would like some advice on which watch to buy. Ideally I would like it to support LTE (not that I'm going to use it at first, as my carrier doesn't support eSIM yet, but I suppose a watch with LTE can work as a Bluetooth device as well. Will LTE drain battery without setting it up or using it at all?

I read many comments and saw many videos, so I just really don't know if it is worth getting a  Galaxy watch 4 44mm LTE or a Galaxy watch 5 44mm LTE  (more expensive, around 90 EUR extra than watch 4). Some claim that  Galaxy watch 5 44mm has worse battery life than Galaxy watch 4 44mm, although I don't know if this is true or how it's possible, because watch 5 has a larger battery capacity than watch 4. I trust though the comments of this YouTuber, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj\_gCcq92GU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj_gCcq92GU) which he says he found out that watch 5 drains battery faster than watch 4 for the same settings. 

I'm not really a sporty person, so I'm going to use the watch mainly for notifications, replying to SMS, calling (1-2 calls per day maybe or none at all) and on demand heart rate and oxygen measurement, or NFC payment (turn it on only when I need it). Also I might use it to track my running or walking or sleeping once in a while. So Ideally I will have the Always on Display off and also raise/tilt to wake off, power saving mode on, and uninstall Google Assistant (I read it consumes a lot of battery). 

I am also thinking about Galaxy 5 Pro 45mm LTE because it has a really good battery but I don't like much it's design, and that bezel, which makes it difficult to put it under your shirt (could be wrong, as I haven't seen it in person), and also that it's much more expensive than watch 5 or watch 4. 

I am not sure how many days I can get from having those settings on each of these smartwatches. Definitely, Galaxy 5 Pro 45mm can go like a week with a single charge I believe.

I also have in mind, ticwatch E3 which is cheaper of all, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, and regarding battery I read that it can go 4-5 days with those settingsGalaxy watch 5 44mm or Galaxy watch 4 44mm",0,GalaxyWatch

I just figured it was probably a contact sync bug and whatever. Finally played around today to narrow down what exactly was happening.


All contacts were in fact syncing between watch&lt;-&gt;phone, but if a contact is a *business* and does not have a ""first name"" ""last name"" field present, it will show up at the bottom of the watch Contacts app as just the number, and also in messages and calls as just the number.


Giving the contact a First/Last Name, will then makes the watch contact properly tag in messages/calls. The Samsung watch contacts app does not seem to have any settings to change any kind of behavior.


This isn't a solution, but a workaround, and thankfully an explanation for the errant behavior.


Hopefully Samsung fixes the way the WearOS watches handle contacts in a future update to list business name if the contact doesn't contain a First/Last Name field. Their Tizen watches do not seem to have this problem. The WearOS flavor feels very beta versus the Tizen ones. (Like why does the DnD widget in the Quick Panel not let you choose 1, 2, forever hours like it does in the Tizen OS version? Where did the barometric pressure graph go? etc.)


Does Samsung have any method for users to support bug tickets other than screaming into the void?

I mean, I paid premium price for a GW4 and what I got is actually a pretty dumb watch. The pulse reading doesn't really work‚Äîit sometimes 50 bpm higher than my actual pulse as measured by a dedicated pulse monitor.  The inactivity monitor is just as stupid as it gets‚Äîtotally useless. Measuring my stress seems reasonably accurate, except I already know whether I'm stressed or not. BP measuring is disabled in the U.S. (not that it is that reliable in any case). I knew the EKG would not be very reliable, but I thought it would be better than nothing... well...

After a few months of use, these are the functions I use most consistently:

* Timers
* Notifications from my phone (calls, meetings, etc.). This is actually what's most useful. If a cheaper watch can show my notifications, that would seal the deal.
* Outside temperature
* Step counter

At the beginning I used a bunch of functions that, once the novelty wore off, I no longer have any interest in. And some of the ones I'm interested in, don't work reliably as I mentioned in the beginning. 

Once, I asked Bixby to set a reminder for later in the evening and instead set an alarm for the next day too early in the morning and it didn't even let me know. After using several watch faces, will all degrees of beauty and customization, I'm back to a fairly basic one.

Anyways, I'm underwhelmed by the smart watch experience. One thing I like about the GW4 is how bulky it feels on my wrist. I think that's something I would not get out of a fitbit.My next smart watch is going to be a Fitbit",0,GalaxyWatch

My GW4 Classic has not a superb battery life and everyone knows that. So I decided to have very few things on only to preserve its battery (stress on and very few notifications on, auto detect workout on - the latter never gets used because I'm a sedentary type and never do any workout). No HR or sleep tracking/blood oxygen off too. With all that I've been gettin a good 2 days and a couple of hours more...

And for this test I disconnected the watch at 15% (2 days exactly on the battery menu). I went ahead and turned on HR continuous measure. It's charging now and I will use it in this cycle and will see how much exactly the continuous HR sensor will drain the battery. The purpose of this test is to see how much that feature itself impacts this poor battery.

I'm thinking getting a watch 5 (230‚Ç¨), a watch 4 classic (200‚Ç¨) or a pixel watch (380‚Ç¨) - prices in my location for the Bluetooth only versions since I don't care for LTE. The pixel is too expensive so I'll probably get a galaxy.

I've had the GW5 since it was released, preordered it with the sport band. And while I love the sport band, it gets annoying getting the perfect fit. I can't remember which one of the many holes I put my watch on and don't feel like marking it with a sharpie or something. So I end up sometimes with a watch that's too tight or too loose and always am adjusting. 

Anyways, I'm wondering what other great alternatives do you all use? Zox is releasing GW5 bands soon, but not in any designs I like. Solace is another brand I was looking into with stretcht watch bands. But I'm looking for any recommendations of bands! Curious what else is popular!

843,rosiezzzz,"Brand new to smart watches and just started using my Galaxy Watch 5. I've searched but haven't seen an answer to this specific question.

I currently have a security lock on my watch which means it locks when I take it off. As far as I can tell this is the only option for a security lock, and if you turn this off (say, if you have your watch off to play with faces or settings), in order to re-set it you have to do the whole process over again (go to settings, re-choose a pattern or pin).

Is there a quick-lock feature? Or a setting that will only lock if my watch is disconnected from my home wi-fi or phone? It would even help if the watch remembered my previously chosen passcode, so I could just toggle the ""Lock"" on or off.

9 times out of 10 this person isn't using their watch the same way you're using yours , they more than likely have a very minimal watch face with little to no complications. This is where their battery life comes from. If you're like me and have a more active watch face (showing weather, steps, HR, battery etc), with AOD and tilt to wake on as well as using most of the sensors including wifi and Bluetooth (the only thing I have turned off on my GW4 44mm is snore detection). You will probably get about 24 to 30 hours of battery life without charging throughout the day. The thing is, your watch face will probably always be your biggest battery drain, that doesn't mean that you should change your watch settings (turning off aod and tilt to wake) and use Endangered Animals, getting less functionality out of your watch for that 10 extra hours of battery life. You paid money for whatever watch you ended up getting, the people who are getting those 2 days are using their watch their way, it's not going to be the same way you use yours. If your battery life bothers you on your current settings, simply charge it during the day when you have a little free time. That way you can enjoy your watch completely 

I made this post because I feel a bit bad for the folk out there who find themselves comparing their watch battery to others. You should always enjoy your tech products your way even if it means  you have to charge it more than others :). I use all sensors on my watch, as well as using the infobrick watch face which I believe has 5 or 6 complications. I use my watch this way because I like to, it gets me the most functionality. The only thing I don't use is snore detection (I track sleep though) and hey Google.

Enjoy your watch your way, charge more if you have to, but don't make your watch less useful and less enjoyable for your particular use cases just because you are not getting the same battery life as someone who is using their watch with less functionality. At the end of the day, we all use our watches differently, as long as you're enjoying your watch your way, it's okay to not have as much battery life, charge your watch a bit more so that you can continue to enjoy it your way.

On either phone it looks similar. Watch is recognized under Samsung Wearable but when I click it to pair after a while I get info that connection with watch was unsuccessful. Normally as I saw in the internet there suppose to be some kind of pair code/numbers that usually shows up when you pair bluetooth device.

Watch is production date of 15 January 2023 so I believe it may already have latest firmware installed (not exactly sure how to check that). Out of things that I already checked in the google and tried:

* Factory reset Watch using recovery menu (wipe data/cache)
* Factory reset of S23 (as this is new phone I could safely do that)

927,DutchOfBurdock,"So it's actually a thing. Had it myself happen last night, whilst the watch was on charge. It did 75k steps!

OK, let's explain a little. I charge my watch on a small, USB fan. It has a metal cage, so rhe puck sticks to it. I use this to cool the watch and puck during charge and it does a really good job at keeping it cool. Can get from 0 to 100 in under two hours, and the usual 20ish% to 100 in just over an hour.

Thing is, dust had built up into the fan. So I cleaned it, soaked the spinning elements with WD40 and off it went at full, fluidic speed. Here lay the problem. Because the fan is spinning so fast, there is a vibration that is quite noticeable. The night after this clean and the first charge, I did 75k.

I believe, and this is a hypothesis here. A recent update to Samsung Health app is to blame. It has made the accelerometer more sensitive, thinking even the most subtle of vibrations are steps.

I could always buy a new band but it seems crazy to spend money to put a bandaid on something Samsung broke. Any way to roll back the update or increase the sensitivity of the sensor when putting on the watch?

I have a Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with the latest updates. It consistently fails to record my heart rate and blood oxygen during sleep, although it's set to record the heart rate every 10 minutes and blood oxygen recording is enabled.

I tried restarting and resetting the watch to no avail. It doesn't seem like a hardware issue, because sometimes the watch records both the heart rate and the blood oxygen without any issues. I only take the watch off to charge it. Is there any way to get this functionality working all the time?

I was thinking of the Pixel Watch as well but some of their sensors are still disabled and no one has a timeline of when it will be activated.  I'm not waiting... May take a year or until the '2' comes out.  I know Samsung has it already and they are enabled/ready to go.  

So I am looking at the LTE Watch5.  I wouldn't activate the LTE right way and utilize Bluetooth/WiFi.  If I end up needing the LTE and will benefit me, I wanted the watch that could handle it from the get go instead of buying another.

I'm curious though, about the 40mm vs 44mm.  I notice the battery size is different by a significant amount.  In the real world, are folks with the 44mm seeing more life between recharges then the 40mm?  

I know the Pro which really only has a larger battery and built 'tougher' has close to a 3 day battery life.  I'm not about to drop that much cash on a watch though.

1080,tjn182,"Hey all,

Watch is a 40mm WiFi only. Bought in early December 2022.

My new galaxy watch has become nearly unusable overnight.

Up until last Thursday, my watch would easily last from 7am until the following morning (~20% left), and would need a nice charge to 100 before work.

Thursday I noticed my S20 was many updates behind, and went through about 5 software updates back-to-back.

Around 4pm, my watch wants to go into power saving mode. Around 4:15, it's in watch-only mode at 5%, and at 4:25 it's dead. 

Now I am suddenly getting only about 6-8 hours of charge. It drops rapidly, to the point of making the watch useless. This morning I was at 92 percent when a meeting started at 9:30am, and was at 81 percent at 10:10am after the meeting.

I have made zero changes to the watch or anything. Zero changes, the only change was updating my phone. 

The only thing I am reading online for help is to start disabling almost every feature on the watch, which also makes the watch useless. 

Hoping someone has more advice than the typical ""turn off AoD"", ""make heart rate timer at 10 minutes"", ""turn off media controls"".  I have noticed that disabling Bluetooth (and severing connection to my phone) stabilizes the battery life.

1083,Sir_Loppy,"With trade in on Samsung's site (trading in a refurbed gw3C, I assume the gw3C is accepted as it only offers a trade in check box for GW3) which places the price for both the gw5 44mm and gw5 pro within like 20 dollars of eachother.

On one hand battery life and extra durability sounds great, but right now my forerunner 255 is 14mm thick and with the gw5 pro coming in at 15mm thick I do not think I would enjoy having such a chunky lad on my wrist.  The sleeker design of the gw5 44mm looks appealing as well but I worry I will damage the watch easily without the titanium case and stronger glass. Will be purchasing care+ on either watch.

Does anyone have any thoughts?  As long as the battery life on the 44mm can go 1.5 days with relative consistency I'm not sure I'll care too much about the difference and the aesthetic/comfort benefits of the thinner/lighter 44mm has me conflicted as well as the relatively small price gap between the two assuming I don't get scuffed by Samsung during the trade in process.

This surprised me because the built-in workout feature usually keeps running fine in the background when I use other apps.

Any ideas what might be causing this behavior? Is this something the Excercise Timer app might be doing, some WearOS-level ""start workout"" API call (if that even exists, just a wild guess) or something along those lines.

I see Samsung has released several firmware updates and how accurate is the HR/GPS during all of the above mentioned activities?

 I recently purchased the Samsung Watch 5 44 mm and have been figuring out my way around it. I'm currently figuring out how to play music directly from the watch. My SO has the Samsung Active 2 and showed me that hers can play through the watch. I haven't been able to figure out how to do this.

For the record I am using YouTube Music Premium. I can view playlists and select songs, but I'm then prompted to connect to a Bluetooth device and have found no options on enabling playing through the watch. Is this function app specific?

Been using the Galaxy Watch 5 40mm GPS for the past month or so and so far I love it!

I recently noticed a build-up of ""matter"" underneath and around the sides of the watch, guessing it's a combo of dead skin, lotion, etc (YUCK!) I've never cleaned it yet so not too surprised.

The first thing I thought of was to use a microfibre cloth and those PC anti-microbial cleaning liquids.

I then did a Google search and read up on the Samsung FAQ for cleaning the watch, which states to use a lint-free cloth with water, and not use any detergents 

It also states not to expose it to cosmetic products like lotion? Have I accidentally damaged the sensors by doing so for almost a month now?

I'm just leaving this here in case it can help someone in the future. 

I've been trying to connect a gw5's google assistant to the phone, but was getting stuck on ""This phone cannot connect to the watch by bluetooth, etc...""

I followed all the possible solutions I have found, including putting only one google account and resetting multiple times. 

What made it for me was to go to:

Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps &gt; Digital assistant 

Set the digital assistant app to None, and then opening assistant from the app list. For some reason it decided to connect this time and set itself up. Google assistant was somehow the default assistant, but I had just reset the watch and updated the app. So my guess is when updating google assistant (on the watch) it sets itself as default assistant and cause some problems.

1198,LiquorEmittingDiode,"I've had my Galaxy Watch5 44mm for little over a month now. The reviews on Reddit and elsewhere seemed to be mostly positive but I'm blown away by the poor performance almost across the board. Fitness/sleep/health tracking, responsiveness and battery life are all substantially worse than expected. 

\- Battery life is well under 24h from day one unless most features are disabled, including things I'd consider ""base functionality"" like continuous heartrate monitoring.

\- Touch screen has a noticeable latency from day one, especially when trying to cycle between screens. The face completely freezes for a second or so if I try to cycle through them quickly.

\- Sleep tracking quality is very poor. Sleep is also often arbitrarily separated into many smaller ""naps"", each with poor sleep scores, that can't be combined, making the metrics useless (afaik at least, the edit feature doesn't let me do anything in my Samsung Health App). 

\- Blood oxygen measurement doesn't seem very accurate at all.

\- Fitness and heartrate tracking is mediocre at best. Substantially worse than my 6 year old FitBit which measured continuously and lasted well over a week on a single charge for years. This one seems to lose the ability to measure anything accurately once you start moving or sweating at all.

\- Advanced features such as ECG and body composition take 30 seconds to measure, but fail most of the time requiring many attempts and several minutes to get a reading.

\- As a final FU to the customer, the charger requires an uncommon adapter that is not included with the watch. Really enjoyed not being able to use this until the stores reopened after Christmas. 

I'm really at a loss here. Are there some tips/settings I'm not aware of that will make this thing functional? Did I get a dud? Is health tracking more of an afterthought for most buyers and not heavily factored into reviews? How much worse should I expect the battery life and performance/latency to get with age?Very Disappointed with my Galaxy Watch5. What am I missing?",0,GalaxyWatch

My BS alarms are ringing hard. Surely this cannot be a software issue?

1261,SonicPhoenix,"I thought I might share something I discovered recently after a few months of frustration with both problems.  I noticed that my Watch 5 44mm non-LTE would sometimes last for two plus days between charges but sometimes run down in less than a day.  Battery consumption was incredibly inconsistent,  losing only 1-2%% per hour then draining 10% in 30 minutes without any change in usage.  I've also been having trouble with my Galaxy S22 video and audio sporadically stuttering across multiple apps.

&amp;#x200B;

Two entirely separate problems that are both well documented among users right?  Turns out, at least in my case, they were linked.  I noticed that sometimes when I tried to change the media volume on my phone, instead of increasing or decreasing by one notch per click, it would change unpredictably, increasing a few notches then decreasing a few notches on a single button press as if a child were playing with a volume dial.  Eventually I noticed that this volume behavior was linked to the video stuttering.  Originally I would have to reboot my phone to fix the problem but I eventually determined that toggling airplane mode also solved the issue and eventually narrowed it down to toggling the bluetooth.  Toggling the bluetooth got me thinking so the next time I noticed that the Watch 5 battery was draining rapidly, I checked my phone and the erratic volume along with video stuttering was present.  Toggled the bluetooth on the phone and everything, including batter consumption went back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this doesn't solve the problem entirely but with a little extra awareness, this has turned a problem that nearly had me return the watch into something that is manageable with minor annoyance.  Additionally, if Samsung happens to check this sub, maybe this information can help them resolve the battery drain issue many of us are seeing.  I reported this to Samsung via their website but have no idea if it will get to the right people or if it vanishes into the void.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you've been having either, or both, of these problems and none of the fixes from other Googled threads are working, try toggling the bluetooth and see if it helps.A Tale of Two Problems - Watch 5 battery drain and S22 video stuttering",0,GalaxyWatch

I even charged it to 100% before I went to bed and woke up with my watch at 85%.

1263,ping1pong," In the last a couple of weeks, the information shown on the workout screens on Samsung Health App becomes less and less on my watch 5. Initially, the Walking workout started showing less information, now the running behaves the¬†same. Attached are the two screens shown on watch for running. You can see only duration and Pace/heart rate information are displayed. Where is the number such as max pace, distance, steps, etc?¬† Even worse, if I choose walk workout, then only duration is repeatedly (4 times) shown on the screen on watch. One thing I want to mention is the correct information is still shown in the health app on my Samsung phone once I connect the watch to the phone, but the watch doesn't show the missing information.

From conducting lots of research in the smartwatch space, a common theme I found was people wanting to share their activity and goals with friends who own a different smart watch brand.

Everyone also receives their very own avatar who can be levelled up through hitting your goal each week (no pay to win).

1289,Sirts,"I've been thinking to switch from Spotify to YTM, since I already order Youtube Premium. On my GW4 Spotify's offline playback works as expected:

I create a playlist on phone or computer, save it watch, and it downloads there. I can also select indiviual songs from the playlist offline, and if I add new songs to playlist, it updates on watch when the app is open and watch or Wifi connection is available.

With YTM, when I add new songs to playlist on phone, the downloaded playlist doesn't seem to update on watch. Within few days I had YTM opened on watch and phone, both connected on Wifi, and songs just weren't added. When I deleted the playlist from watch, and downloaded it again, all the new songs were there, so does YTM just lack the playlist update feature, or is it buggy for me?  

 Also I haven't found a way to quickly jump to an individual song on playlist, should that be possible?

However, some days my GW4 constantly records my pulse at about 40bpm below other days. An example: Usually it tracks at about 175 bpm. But on some days, it stays around 135 bpm. 

I have measured my pulse rate by hand (i.e. putting a finger on my vein and counting it), and I can surely say that 175 is the closer number, it is definitely not 135. 

As far as I can tell, this is very random, I don't think I can reproduce it on purpose. Is this a bug encountered by others as well?

(Also, this is probably unlikely, but I have a hunch): This almost seems like a (Nyquist) sampling problem! If I finish my exercise, I obviously expect my heart rate to drop. BUT, it actually rises! This sounds as if the tracker cannot correctly sample 175-180, and is erratically reporting it as 130; but when my heart rate drops, it now gets back into the ""acceptable"" range, and hence the watch suddenly starts reporting it correctly.GW4: Erratic pulse rate on random days",0,GalaxyWatch

1337,Dubiousbot,"So a few people I know (early 30s) passed away from COVID spike protein related heart issues.

I don't have any experience with wearables but wanted to know what metrics can they track that can give insight into possible cardiac irregularities.

So far what I've gleaned from couple of weeks of research:

Apple watch:
1. Super accurate heart rate tracking (great, but others aren't terrible either)
2. Does not monitor heart rate constantly unless it detects a workout (deal-breaker for this particular usecase since you'd want continuous monitoring to spot an intermittent issue?)
3. Irregular rhythm monitoring is not continuous, rather it does spot checks (also a deal breaker?)


Fitbit sense 2 and charge 5:
Constant HR monitoring and irregular rhythm as well? They fail as smart watches but better for health tracking?

Samsung watch 5:

1. No irregular rhythm monitoring
2. Constant HR monitoring

Are the above correct? Pls correct if wrong. Would HRV be relevant here? (The one that whoop excels at)

Basically, if I have it connected to my phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra) via Bluetooth, randomly all the audio that comes out of my phone will sound choppy/breaking. Volume control will only update during the split second there is audio playing. This will happen regardless of whether the audio is outputting to the phone's speaker or to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds. 

Although I managed to narrow down the issue to the watch connection, I do not know exactly what is causing it because disconnecting and reconnecting the watch will temporarily solve the audio problems until the audio decides on being choppy again with no obvious trigger. The only workaround I have found is to disable ""calls"" toggle under the phone's Bluetooth settings. This will keep my watch connected and still display notifications, but I will not be able to take Bluetooth calls with the watch anymore, which I don't want.

Something funny I noticed: if I start find my phone while the audio is choppy it will temporarily fix the audio on my phone for about 5 seconds before going back to playing like a scratched-up CD.

I recently got a Google Pixel 7 Pro and i currently have a galaxy watch 4 LTE and i am hoping someone can help me. Samsung and verizon have been no help at all. 

Current Issues

My galaxy watch has a plan through verizon it is set to be always on instead of auto. I still cannot use the watch without my phone being on or connected to Bluetooth. I have talked to verizon and samsung and they said they have no answers. 

My second issue is if i try to message someone from my watch in google messages it wants me to go to the inbox on my phone. It says "" phone is online switch to phone inbox"" I click dismiss and it just takes me back to the switch to phone inbox screen. So, I tried to use Samsung messages and it gives my watch a completely different number. 

Things i have tried: 

Factory resetting watch and reconnecting to phone plan.

1) lte model works like on Apple Watches? You still get calls and sms, whatsapp or other notifications while connected to lte only?
2) battery life impact when connected to your phone/Wi-Fi is not impacted? As it should enable LtE only if neither Wi-Fi or phone BT is available? Or does it still drain to some extent?
3) battery life is so much better on the pro that overcompensate for the big bulky design?

I'm considering purchasing the galaxy watch4 since it is less expensive than the galaxy watch5, and let's be honest - I do not see any differences between them except in the color availability and the wireless charging, which isn't a big issue for me.

In my home country: Watch5 is 590$

Watch4 is 240$ a 300$ less expensive than watch5, and the green band is ''amazing.''

Classic watch4 is 256$.

I think the offer is more than ''awesome'' for me, and I do not like that you have to install all the updates at once when you buy a brand-new Samsung device.

1479,ilovemywestern,"Hi everybody! Decided to get a different GW, which means I have to return to Amazon the GW4 that I've been testing out for a month-ish now.

Especially since I have connected my Google account to it already so that I could test out calendar access, I'm paranoid about: 

* Accidentally leaving behind personal data or
* Not erasing it properly which leaves my data recoverable to somebody who knows how to dig it up. 

Thoughts? What more can I do besides a factory reset? I have concerns about whether a factory reset is enough to actually scrub all data. I know [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/android-factory-reset-doesnt-delete-everything-heres-how-to-really-wipe-your-data/374192/) is old and refers to Android phones, but I wonder if those findings extend to Android smartwatches.

Recently I've been wearing my watch over night to track all my sleep stats and record them.

Is this enough data to be a cause for concern? The reason I ask is that my oxygen reading during the day are always 96-99%.

1574,_ItsPine_,"Since there are lots of ppl having difficulty with their watch not showing in WFS, i'd like to share with you my experience of getting it to work using the adb wifi method. Hope it helps  
Step-by-step guide:  
1. Make sure to have both your watch and pc connected to the same wifi network  
2. (on your watch) enable developer options -&gt; turn on adb debugging -&gt; turn on debug over wifi, wait for a few seconds  
3. (on your watch) you'll see your ip address in the form of 192.168.xxx.xxx under the debug over wifi option, write it down, put the watch aside unlocked   
4. (on your pc) [Download the Android SDK Platform Tools ZIP file for Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip), extract it  (I've had toubles with the Minimal ADB and Fastboot, so i'd suggest using this one instead)  
5. (on your pc) launch cmd, enter the following 2 command lines one by one  
  
cd C:\\Users\\xxx\\Downloads\\platform-tools  
(this should be the default location of the adb platform tools where xxx is your username)  
  
adb connect 192.168.xxx.xxx  
(replace the x's with your ip address copied from your watch)  
  
6. Confirm the adb prompt showing on your watch (i'd go for the *always allow* so you won't have to repeat the step again)  
  
normally you will see *connected to 192.168.xxx.xxx* right after entering the second command and confirming adb on your watch

1575,WhenTheFoxGRINS,"I've had my Galaxy Watch 4 for over a month now, and I really hate the sleep tracker on it.

I'd been using Fitbit trackers for years prior to this, and never had any troubles with them.

With the Samsung Health app, it very frequently fails to recognize when I'm actually asleep ‚Äì especially when it comes to napping, which I do frequently due to certain health conditions.

Like, I can take an hour long nap at 2 pm and it won't even recognize it!

On top of that, it doesn't really give me a good idea of how much I've actually slept ‚Äì which is the most important feature for me.  It'll say something like ""you slept 6 hours and 42 minutes last night,"" on my actual watch, but when I go into the app on my phone, I'll find that the ACTUAL time I was asleep was really only 4 hours and 28 minutes.

I have no idea why it wouldn't just tell me the actual amount of time I was asleep from the start??

That, on top of the fact that it rarely doesn't detect my naps (even 3-4 hours in the middle of the day frequently won't be counted ‚Äì as if it simply can't comprehend the concept of sleeping any other time but night!), just makes this thing nearly useless for me.

I don't need anything fancy, like blood oxygen, snoring, or even stages of sleep I could pass on (though they're appreciated).  I just want a reliable app that will tell me when I was asleep and when I was not.  That's it.

Any recommendations?What are some alternatives to the Samsung Health app for the Galaxy Watch 4?",0,GalaxyWatch

So this evening I lost my phone in the kitchen, but I didn't know at the time it was exactly that room. 

So that's an easy fix right? Just your watch to ring it.
Except I was in a different room and by then my phone and watch disconnected, but even if I was in the kitchen and it says connected, it didn't ring for some reason.

So then I tried Google assistant as it only needs an Internet connection for the watch and then it just rings your phone.

But here comes the real issue, I was connected to the WiFi as the watch itself, but Google assistant keeps demanding an Internet connection to work. I even tried both 5ghz and 2.4ghz. So IDK if it was Google's fault or the watch's fault, but it's certainly not the Internet connection because I see my mom watching Netflix and my cousin playing an online game

So eventually I just stopped being a lazy bum and use the old fashion method of actually finding it myself.

TLDR: Watch easily disconnects from the phone, and sometimes doesn't ring despite being connected.

1598,mangoed,"So I recently upgraded from first-gen GW to GW5pro. The old, Tizen-based GW still worked fine, but I imagined that jumping from gen 1 to gen 5 would be a huge difference (in reality it's pretty modest, although it was still worth it). Better sleep tracking was one of the things that I wanted the most, because occasionally I'm suffering from insomnia; it's an intermittent issue and I'm trying to get a better understanding of how my body rests and what I can do to ensure good sleep. GW1 was pretty inaccurate and often recorded about 10 minutes of deep sleep per night, which I blamed on outdated sensors. GW5 has more and better sensors for sleep tracking, and, indeed, it reports between 40 to 75 minutes of deep sleep on most nights, which sounds more reasonable.

A couple of nights ago I was finally hit with insomnia and spent a sleepless night. In the morning looked at my watch: sleep score 70/100, even though ""actual sleep time"" was only 4.5 hours. I'm not quite sure where this ""actual sleep time"" comes from, probably from the periods when I was lying still and trying to fall asleep. But reported 40 minutes of deep sleep is absolutely unrealistic.

[the night of bad sleep](https://preview.redd.it/zimn5xobjyba1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa7a3f64ca1bf6532387bded73f645ab3801c285)

Last night my sleep was much better, I had a chance to recover after the sleepless night and rest properly. GW, however, registered many short periods of being awake, decided that I was oversleeping (total sleep time 10 hrs 40 min, actual sleep time 9 hrs 36 min), and rated my sleep 51/100. Heck, I know that I was sleeping well, I feel the effects of good night's sleep in my body, but the bloody tracker on my wrist seriously thinks that the previous night was 20% better. WTF?

One of the obvious flaws is that Samsung Health app decides whether you had enough, not enough, or too much sleep based on total sleep time, not actual sleep time. But I can also sense the issues with the sensors (pun intended) and algorithms that detect various stages of sleep. Last but not least, the ""sleep score"" calculated by Samsung is a joke and I can't take it seriously.Opinion: GW sleep tracking is trash",0,GalaxyWatch

My watch is collecting all kinds of scarcthes on the case and there's even silver showing through on the bezel after a couple days of use while kept under a hoodie sleeve and never banged on anything (I would have known and checked it). Some of these you can even barely kinda feel with your nail (on the Ti). I don't think anything should have done this to the watch as far as my use is concerned.That being said, after a year of use I bet this thing will be pretty uniformly scuffed and develop a rugged brushed ti look which I'm all for, this is also Ti and can be very easily finished. I've heard the black one is harder to scratch but won't show wear from your use as gracefully. Screen is mint and should be as hard to wreck as a real watch. Software is fantastic and all things considered this is some of the best money I've spent on tech and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat but please do manage your expectations of the titanium case and bezel on the grey model.Grey Watch 5 Pro Is Awesome But Scratches Easily",0,GalaxyWatch

I noticed recently that sometimes my watch will enter a state where it drains about 30% of battery per hour. I've checked in Battery Historian and the leak seems to be caused to ImsService acquiring a constant wake lock.

Reading about it a bit, ImsService is related to VoLTE, RCS and similar 4G services. I've since set the watch to 3G only mode, and haven't noticed the battery leak since. If you want to keep mobile data on (which seems to require 4G to be on), you can also turn off VoLTE using adb:

I deciding between these two watches and right at the start I have to say that my last Wear OS watches was TicWatch E from 2017 that lasted me fo 3 years. Admittedly their battery life was awful and they died after 3 years because AMOLED display completely burned down. So in case of that and year long pause from any wearable (occasionally MiBand 3) I want to buy a new device. TicWatch E has 1.4"" inch (44mm) display so I thought that that would be my first spec that I want, although Wear OS. Other spec's like NFC connectivity is on the table. LTE isn't that important so basic WiFi model is suitable. But with all battery related problems that I had with TicWatch E I'm really cautious about Galaxy Watch 4 and their battery life. I know that differences between 4 and 5 are almost none, Beside Gorilla glass at 4 and Sapphire Cristal at 5 with somewhere around 15% more battery life and fast charging.
So it's tough for me to decide and Reddit really helped me a lot in a past so here I am again.
Thanks for you help.

1804,superseven27,"On my almost new GW4 certain workout modes are not able to track the heart rate. 

In other workout modes HR tracking works perfectly fine which makes me think that it must be a SW problem. 

I can activate the tracking for e.g. treadmill and HR tracks perfectly. 
When I stop that tracking and start elliptical machine mode, the watch says that it can't track HR. Although it did show my (reasonable) HR in workout overview before and in the other tracking mode. 

Same for bicycle ergometer, rowing machine, stepper - none of these work, while others track HR perfectly. 

This is 100% reproducible and a different sequence of workouts, rebooting the watch, updating to newest version, don't help. Even wearing the watch differently or cleaning the sensor does not work (Since tracking works in certain workout modes I think this isn't the solution anyway).

This week, I tried using the built-in app instead of Strava to see if I would get a different result, but the same thing happened. 

I do not have a metal band, so that shouldn't affect gps accuracy. The watch is brand new, only a couple of weeks old. It also has LTE connectivity which is enabled.

## How to Change the band of the Gear s3 Frontier

There are several ways to change the band on the Gear S3 Frontier, it can get though especially for people who haven‚Äôt changed a watch band before or are new to Samsung watches, So here are tips to changing the Samsung gear s3 frontier watch band.

1. **Quick Release Pins**: The Gear S3 Frontier comes with quick release pins on the back of the watch that allow you to easily remove and attach the band. Simply push the pin in and the band will come off. To attach a new band, align the holes on the band with the pins and push the pins through.
2. **Screwdriver**: If the quick release pins are not working or you don‚Äôt have them, you can use a small screwdriver to remove the screws on the back of the watch that hold the band in place. Be careful not to strip the screws or damage the watch.
3. **Band Replacement Tool**: Samsung sells a band replacement tool specifically designed for the Gear S3 Frontier that makes it easier to remove and attach the band. The tool has a fork-like end that fits over the pins and a handle that you can use to push the pins in or pull them out.
4. **Take it to a Professional**: If you are not comfortable attempting to change the band on your own, you can take it to a professional watch repair shop. They should be able to change the band for you.
5. **Third-Party Adapter**: Some third-party companies make adapters that allow you to use any standard 22mm watch band with your Gear S3 Frontier. These adapters attach to the back of the watch and provide holes for the quick release pins or screws to go through.
6. **Spring Bar Tool**: A spring bar tool is a specialized tool that is used to remove and attach watch bands. It has two pointed ends that can be used to push in or pull out the spring bars that hold the band in place.
7. **Use the Original Band**: If you want to change the band but don‚Äôt want to purchase a new one, you can try using the original band that came with the watch. The band may be hidden behind the watch face and can be removed by gently prying it off with a thin tool such as a small flathead screwdriver or a butter knife.   
 

 

1. **A review of the different types of bands available for the Gear S3 Frontier and their pros and cons.**

There are several types of bands available for the Gear S3 Frontier, each with their own set of pros and cons. Here is a review of some of the most common types of bands:

 

**1. Leather**: Leather bands are classic and stylish, and they can dress up or dress down the look of your Gear S3 Frontier. They are also comfortable to wear and can conform to the shape of your wrist over time. However, leather bands are not as durable as some other materials and may require more maintenance to keep them looking good. They may also be less suitable for activities that involve sweating or getting the band wet.

**Price**: **$16.89**

 

**2. Stainless Steel**: Stainless steel bands are strong, durable, and resistant to wear and tear. They are also water resistant and can withstand exposure to moisture. Stainless steel bands tend to be more expensive than other types of bands and can be heavy to wear. They may also be less comfortable than bands made of softer materials.

**Price: $17.99**

 

**3. Silicone**: Silicone bands are a popular choice for sports and other physical activities because they are lightweight, flexible, and sweat resistant. They are also inexpensive and easy to clean. However, silicone bands may not be as stylish as other types of bands and may not be suitable for formal occasions.

**Price: $4.99**

 

**4. Nylon**: Nylon bands are strong, durable, and resistant to wear and tear. They are also lightweight and comfortable to wear. Nylon bands are often used in sports and outdoor activities and are available in a variety of colors and patterns. However, nylon bands may not be as stylish as some other types of bands and may not be suitable for formal occasions.

**Price: $15.39**

 

**5. Canvas band**: canvas bands are a popular choice for the Gear S3 Frontier because they are stylish, comfortable, and durable. They are made of a strong, woven fabric that is resistant to wear and tear and can withstand exposure to moisture. Canvas bands are also lightweight and flexible, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. They are available in a wide range of colors and patterns, so you can choose a band that matches your personal style.

**Price: $13.98**

 

It‚Äôs worth noting that the Gear S3 Frontier is also compatible with standard 22mm watch bands, so you have a wide range of options to choose from. You can find bands made of materials such as rubber, plastic, and even fabric. Just make sure that the band you choose is compatible with the quick release pins or screws on the back of the watch.

 

## Tips for choosing the right band for your Gear S3 Frontier based on your personal style and needs.

There are a few factors to consider when choosing the right band for your Gear S3 Frontier:

1. **Material**: Consider the material of the band, as this will affect the look, feel, and durability of the band. Options include leather, silicone, metal, and more.
2. **Fit:** Make sure the band is a comfortable fit for your wrist. It should be snug, but not too tight.
3. **Style:** Choose a band that matches your personal style. Do you prefer a more classic, timeless look or something more modern and trendy?
4. **Needs:** Think about your daily activities and what kind of band would be most suitable for your needs. For example, if you are active and frequently participate in sports, a silicone band may be a good choice because it is more sweat-resistant.
5. **Price:** Determine your budget and look for bands that fit within it. Keep in mind that higher-quality bands may cost more, but they may also be more durable and last longer.
6. **Compatibility:** Make sure the band is compatible with your Gear S3 Frontier. Some bands are designed specifically for the Gear S3, while others may be compatible with other models or brands of smartwatches.

¬†The right band for you will depend on your personal style, needs, and budget. Consider these factors and take the time to try on and compare different bands to find the one that is best for you.

## Ideas for dressing up or dressing down the Gear S3 Frontier with different bands.

There are several ways you can dress up or dress down your Gear S3 Frontier with different bands:

1. If you want to dress up your Gear S3 Frontier, you can choose a band made of materials like leather or stainless steel. These bands tend to be more expensive and give the watch a more formal, sophisticated look.
2. If you want to dress down your Gear S3 Frontier, you can choose a band made of materials like silicone or rubber. These bands are more casual and sporty and are great for everyday wear.
3. You can also choose a band with a unique pattern or design to add some personality and style to your watch. There are many options available, including bands with floral, animal, or abstract patterns.
4. Another option is to switch out the band for a different color. Choosing a band in a bold, bright color can add a pop of interest to your watch.
5. If you want to switch up your look frequently, you can even invest in multiple bands and switch them out depending on the occasion or your outfit.

## A comparison of third-party bands vs. official Samsung bands.

Lets, say you are comparing a samsung watch or the bands actually and you are stuck with making a decision on which one to choose or buy,¬†

Here are some points to consider when comparing third-party bands to official Samsung bands:

1. **Compatibility**: Make sure that the third-party band is compatible with your Samsung watch. Not all third-party bands will fit all models of Samsung watches.
2. **Quality**: Official Samsung bands are likely to be of higher quality and have a more premium feel compared to third-party bands. However, this is not always the case and you may be able to find third-party bands that are just as high quality as official bands.
3. **Price**: Third-party bands may be less expensive than official Samsung bands. However, you may be sacrificing quality and durability for a lower price.
4. **Availability**: Official Samsung bands may be more widely available and easier to find, especially if you need a replacement band for your watch.
5. **Warranty**: Official Samsung bands may come with a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty, while third-party bands may not. If the band fails or breaks, you may have to purchase a new one if it is not covered under a warranty.

Ultimately, the choice between an official Samsung band and a third-party band will depend on your individual needs and preferences. It may be worth considering a third-party band if you are looking for a lower price and don‚Äôt mind sacrificing some quality and availability. However, if you want the peace of mind that comes with a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty and higher quality materials, an official **Samsung band** definetly¬† is the better choice.

## How to care for and maintain different types of bands.

There are many different types of bands, each with its own unique set of care and maintenance needs. Here are a few general tips for caring for and maintaining different types of bands:

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the metal.
3. **Rubber or silicone bands**: Rubber or silicone bands are generally very easy to care for. Simply wash them with soap and water to keep them clean. Avoid exposing them to extreme heat or UV light, as this can cause them to become brittle or fade.
4. **Fabric or nylon bands**: Fabric or nylon bands should be kept clean and dry. Avoid getting them wet or exposing them to extreme heat. If the band gets dirty, you can gently spot clean it with a soft, dry cloth or a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the fabric.
5. **Wood or bamboo bands**: Wood or bamboo bands should be kept clean and dry. Avoid getting them wet or exposing them to extreme heat. If the band gets dirty, you can gently wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If it gets really dirty, you can use a mild soap and water to clean it, but be sure to let it dry completely before wearing it again. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the wood.

**The key to caring for and maintaining any type of band is to handle it gently, keep it clean and dry, and avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or harsh chemicals.**

I have been using the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic with a Oneplus Nord for a while.

But every time i try to set up the watch it fails after the pairing pop up.

The watch is stuck on the screen which tells me to finish the setup on my phone. My phone is stuck on the menu where you need to select your device. I've tried resetting my watch and i've tried resetting the phone (after i just finished setting everything up -\_-) but still it won't work.

I'm trying to update my Watch 4's software, but it seems to refuse to do so! Please help!

1. I've tried to perform the update from my phone's Galaxy Wearable app. It would download the update, but endlessly hang on ""copying update"" with no ETA listed (only ""--:--"").
2. I've tried rebooting both devices, no go.
3. I've tried performing the update directly from the watch, with the connection severed from the phone. The watch seems to insist on performing the update via bluetooth via the phone.
4. I've tried resetting the watch, though I've noticed that it's not a complete factory default... it has saved my WiFi networks (unless that was transferred from the phone when I've re-paired it with the app).

I'm running out of ideas and I'm finding the entire experience exasperating. Any advice?

The instructions were to use the phone watch management app, force stop Bixby and then I could use the disable button but it didn't work.

I would rather not have to force some different OS into the watch and fully replace the software but I can not stand Bixby. I can't remove it's permissions and I can't disable it I'm just going to stop using the approved software but I'd rather not do that as besides Bixby I like it but I will not tolerate Bixby.

1956,Mr_Deps,"Apologies I know there are many threads on battery life &amp; I know, battery life is not the strong point of these watches, especially the smaller sizes (42mm 4 classic) so I didn't really want to ask anyone's opinion because it's been done, many times.

The thing is though, it's not necessarily bad battery life, it's completely unpredictable battery life. When I got the watch at the start of December I was just about getting from 9am to 9:30pm before needing to charge so I could track sleep. I adjusted some settings &amp; then I didn't need to charge til the next morning (with bedtime mode on overnight)

Then it got inexplicably worse again, so I cleared the cache, watched many videos about battery life &amp; turned off everything I don't need. It was much improved, mostly getting me through a day &amp; night, but some days seem a lot worse than others, with pretty much no interactions. The screenshot is taken from today, all I've done is set a timer once &amp; looked at my steps when it reminded me to move. No apps are left open.

So it's telling me I have 21 hours left, but in 1.5 hours it's used 16% battery ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è surely I shouldn't need to clear the cache again? 

A few more bits of info;

I use AOD but not raise to wake
Location is off
WiFi off
NFT off
Brightness under 50%
I do get movement reminders
Heart rate tracking constant
Stress manual
Only notifications on are WhatsApp 

It is the LTE model, but that isn't used &amp; is off

1957,Tomick,"Hi,

I like having a classic look for a watch.  
So I want to buy the Classic 46mm with a metal brace.  


My wrist is 19 cm.  
I tried to normal watch4 (44mm) from a colleague but it felt a little bit bulky (like, levitating?), but that might be because of the rubber stock band.

Knowing this.  
Is sleeping with it doable/annoying with the 46mm + metal brace? What are your experiences with it?  
Should I go for the 42 version?

I assume sleep mode only works when you actually keep it on you wrist during the night?

There would be numerous benefits to wearing the watch while training, such as tracking health metrics, timing various drills, quick access to class lesson plan notes (not sure if I would ever do this but it's an option if I have a detailed lesson plan), taking voice notes etc. 

 I'm obviously concerned about possibly scraping someone with the watch so I wouldn't consider wearing it without a protective sleeve I could slide on and off. And I would be very cognizant of it's placement during chokes etc. In terms of durability, is there any major concern? I feel like the acceleration/deceleration is probably no more than someone play tennis, but I also have no idea where the limits of the watch are.

After removing the main unit (battery and stuff) the back of the display had some moisture.

From the very beginning my watch would not show any notifications until I restarted my phone. I googled the potential solutions and they said to either restart the watch, restart the phone, do both or do a hard reset of the watch. I tried all of that and the problem persists. 

I did the hard reset just yesterday, and until that day the notifications were showing unless my phone was connected. As soon as I went a few rooms away from the phone and it disconnected - the notifications would stop. All the other functions worked properly and the notifications could be restored by restarting my phone. 
Now after the hard reset - the notifications stop even without disconnecting from the phone. They just stop appearing after a while.

1994,crazyjockey,"Hi all,

I got my mum a Galaxy Watch 5 LTE 40mm, and the battery life is about 21 hours from full charge, which is much less than I expected (reviews saying Samsung claims up to 50 hours).  She's had the watch for several weeks now, so this isn't a first-use battery improvement type thing.

I got the watch for her to use for fall detection and SOS alerting, so she is not a heavy user of the watch in other respects.  These are the optimisations/configurations I've applied to the watch, some of which I have taken from [the battery optimisation guide on the samsung website](https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/increase-battery-life-on-galaxy-watch/):
* Software fully up to date
* Heart rate tracking every 10 mins while still
* Stress tracking manual only
* Connections: bluetooth on, LTE on, wifi off, NFC off
* AOD off
* Voice wakeup off for bixby &amp; google assistant
* Notifications are disabled for everything except phone calls.  Screen does not turn on for notifications.
* Power saving mode is enabled.
* Location enabled

I spoke to Samsung support and the support rep told me the 44mm watch with its larger battery can only get up to 24 hours battery life.  I doubt this because of the reviews I've read but the Samsung website doesn't actually provide any comment (that I can find) on battery duration.

Can anyone with a similar configuration tell me what kind of battery life they get, or provide any other battery optimisation suggestions (keeping in mind that I do want things like LTE and location so it can be effectively used as a SOS/fall detection device) Thanks!Battery drain on Galaxy Watch 5 LTE 40mm",0,GalaxyWatch
