A week ago I bought myself an Apple Watch 8 and I was really happy with a lot. However, I ran into a lot of difficulties that no one seems to be going to solve.

Well, firstly, I do not receive a notification about an incoming call from whatsapp, skype, telegram, viber, facebook messenger. I don't get any call notifications at all unless it's a phone call.

It surprises me that there is not a single blogger on YouTube who would raise this issue. It feels like people are afraid to speak publicly about the problems of Apple Watch.

I explained to her the different models and bands, worked with her to identify which one would be the best and sent her off to the Apple Store for a try-on appointment to check it.

Just got a call from her telling me that she decided not to buy it because ""my old one showed me my blood pressure and the Apple guy said that this doesn't do that. For the price I'm paying, it should show my blood pressure.""

I tried to explain to her that her old tracker didn't actually show her blood pressure, it just used a janky formula to try and infer it from her age, gender, heart rate and blood oxygenation. She was adamant that it was accurate because ""last time I was at the doctor, it was pretty close to his blood pressure cuff measurement"".

I asked her if she really thought that Apple would deliberately leave it off the watch if it was actually medically significant even though they have all the same sensors as her old tracker and a few more besides. She didn't have an answer beyond ""I want one that gives me my blood pressure.""

I tried a couple more times to convince her but her mind is made up.""My old one showed my blood pressure...""",0,AppleWatch

106,NextavailableID,"Hi,

I have an Apple 4. I work out daily (mainly walks). I am (way) over 60 and review my heart data after work outs.

So, recently i sent my cardiologist a questions about 2 heart measurements: VO2 Max and HRV. Both of these numbers (according to the Watch) is i rate poor. My cardio doctor says not to worry and those numbers mean nothing - he did not explain further...

&amp;#x200B;

So...

1. are these numbers wicked important?
2. My workouts raise my BPM to well above the norm for my age. I've worked my ass off gettin my heart up to snuff
3. Is my Watch old, in that it is not accurately picking up this data?
4. Do these measurements i mentioned apply to ""real athletes"", people that are in incredible shape - the numbers are not applicable to my age group?

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is to buy a more basic Apple watch, like the watch 7 or 8, simply for putting on when running and listening to Spotify from there.

The watch though‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve gotta say, I‚Äôm fairly displeased with how well it‚Äôs working overall?  The walkie talkie function was such a cool selling point for us, but it just flat-out doesn‚Äôt function!  As well as this, the Apple Fitness medals are glitchy, delayed, or in some instances just aren‚Äôt triggering!  My partner was super excited to win our first week of fitness competition, only to see a ‚Äúthe last day of your competition is competition_end_day‚Äù message underneath the medal, with no medal being awarded.  I‚Äôve also had issues with a few medals disappearing, and not being restored - persisting through restarts of both the phone and the watch.  Both of these issues appear to be known too - with posts from 2019 on the apple forums claiming similar experiences.

The unlock iPhone feature (when your face is obscured / FaceID isn‚Äôt recognising you) is also lovely in theory, but in practice seems to work less than 20 percent of the time?

It is the base level for maintaining the machine.  It is the same all day.  Apple thinks it is the minimum heart rate at various periods during the day; that has very little bearing on the real RHR.  Moreover, it measures often when you are sitting doing something -=- like eating or working on the computer.  That requires energy to sit up, to move your hands, to think; it other words it raises your heart rate.

Close your rings is for the subset of us that have the AW and the move more includes our AW-less friends and it‚Äôs just a step challenge. 

For the close your rings challenge, it asks for your weight to determine the move goal. Instead of pulling this from Apple Health, it just asks for manual entry and people can lie therefore having a much lower move goal. 

For the move more challenge, it pulls from Apple Health, however within Apple Health you can manually add steps to get the most points.  (And even if you make the move more challenge based on a move goal it ends up being the same cheating method of before)

So is there a group challenge app that will base weight on what‚Äôs in Apple Health and possibly also ignore manually added steps?

330,quinnbryant,"Right, so for the past week I have experienced this bullshit error with both ‚Äúgreen snake of death‚Äù and ‚Äúred snake of death‚Äù on my Apple Watch Series 4. Like many of you who are probably reading this because you have the same issue, it occurred when connecting to the charger. I have fixed it now after replacing the battery but the error still showed with new battery fitted so my (inexperienced and amateur) opinion is that this is a software based issue which can be resolved by resetting the watch‚Äôs battery while connected to the charger. In depth details of my issue and how I solved it below, hopefully will help other people with this shitty fucking error. 

Some pre-context, my watch battery was clearly struggling to perform as would run out of battery very quickly through being used everyday since I owned it. I managed to check the battery health in the settings before I had the snake of death error and it showed 84% battery health. On the last day of it working in charged it as usual over night, put it on and it ran to 0% and turned off in &lt;45mins. 

I figured the battery was fried so I replaced it myself instead of having apple do it as I frequently repair my own tech. The job wasn‚Äôt easy but I managed to get it done and fitted a new battery and a Force Touch gasket as I split the original one when opening the case. 

Once the new battery was fitted I hoped this would fix the error but even then I still had the snake of death. I left it to charge overnight and came back in morning and the green snake error was still there. 

I then took it off the charger and let it run completely flat so nothing would come on screen (not even the red snake error). 

Then I put it back on the charger, green snake appeared again. I held the crown and side button for 15 secs to do a reset of the watch. (When I held the buttons the screen went to black and then flashed the snake error up again, when this happened I just continued to hold the buttons for the 15 sec count, put it down and left it there on charge.)

Walked by the watch about an hour later (maybe longer) and then a white exclamation mark appeared on the screen and went away without me touching the watch. 

The watch then showed the normal charging screen with red text and the time in bold as usually expected. It‚Äôs still charging back up to full now so will respond below in comments if it actually has 100% fixed my issue and if the error ever presents itself again in future. 

Apologies for lengthy essay but with this error I have had little to no details from the info I found online and thought documenting in full what happened with mine could help someone else. So my tip would be let the battery drain to completely flat and then charge it via an Apple branded charger directly through wall socket. Then count the 15 secs reset and leave it there and be patient and hopeful.Snake of Death error",0,AppleWatch

374,matt_legrand,"I've been using the Apple Watch Ultra for over 100 days now and overall it's been a good experience but there have been a few issues I've found annoying.  

Dislikes:

* Extra Ultra watch bands from Apple are expensive 
* Accidental button presses are common - (I flipped the orientation of the watch to avoid action button presses when bending my wrist)
* Size and depth of the watch catches on things frequently
* Action button could be more versatile  - For example, I'd love it to perform short cuts unless I'm in a workout and then I'd like it to perform splits or segments. 
* Limited to iPhone users only (only about 30% of the world wide market for smart phones) 
* Biking with the AWU isn't ideal.  I'd like to be able to connect my cycling radar and power meter.  

Likes:

* Lens and watch body durability has been exceptional 
* Display is bright and vibrant - (2000 nits is crazy bright)
* New running features are excellent (All Apple Watches) 
* Sounds quality is good
* Action button is somewhat customizable -  you can  set it to perform a short cut which can be customized on the iPhone app.
* Swimming with the AWU is ok.  I still wish they'd make a drill mode. 

&amp;#x200B;

Battery life is better but it's still short when compared to some of the Garmin watches.  Overall, I think people would have enjoyed Apple Watches (Series 1-8) will really love the AWU as long as they're ok with the size.  People who are coming from Garmin, Polar or Coros might miss some of the endurance focussed details and health tracking.Apple Watch Ultra Thoughts After 100 Days",0,AppleWatch

Amazon phone support refunded my money and I‚Äôm just waiting for it to post to my account. The process took about 10 minutes so that was nice. No questions asked. I‚Äôm sure there is some kind of matrix of refunds vs issues and we don‚Äôt really return or complain about orders. 

It was bought from a reseller not on prime so I had to wait a week for it to show up and the tracking was between Florida and Colorado for most of the trip which was odd. I missed ordering one Prime from a local warehouse by a couple hours and this was the next best option because the reseller was nearby but apparently they just drop ship. 

So takeaways are I got a free band but I had to wait 6 days to be disappointed. Amazon customer support was great and didn‚Äôt make me feel like I was trying to get one over on them.

Option 2 - Series 5, ¬£140, 'B' condition. The AOD would be nice, and battery and software will be better than Series 3.

Option 3 - Series 7, ¬£160, 'C' condition. Not the best condition, but essentially all the new features.

* when ""Activation Gesture"" is set to ""None"" (== AssistiveTouch is always on automatically) - I can't confirm with AssistiveTouch when e.g. unblocking ""Security &amp; Privacy"" settings on my Mac, because the suggested ""Double Pinch"" gesture activates the ""Backwards"" action (as specified above) instead of confirming
* when ""Activation Gesture"" is set to ""Double Pinch"" - it does both: confirms the operation AND activates AssistiveTouch
* when ""Activation Gesture"" is set to ""Double Clench"" - it seems to work okay: I can confirm the operation with ""Double Pinch"" and activate AssistiveTouch with ""Double Clench"", but...
* ...**I can't make ""Confirm with AssistiveTouch"" work in Wallet at all** \- I tried all the 4 gestures with all the 3 options above, but nothing happens - the prompt doesn't change and the card is not confirmed...

I also have one more annoying issue due to which I had to disable Motion Pointer:

* I had ""Dwell Control"" turned on together with ""Shake to Start"" option
* It was fine for any gesture-only interactions with Watch - I could shake to turn on Motion Pointer, I could shake again to turn it off...
* ...but when I do any ""manual"" interaction, i.e. touch or swipe the screen, click or rotate Digital Crown etc. - **the Motion Pointer ALWAYS appears after that, even if I don't activate it with a shake**. It makes Motion Pointer simply unusable, because you can't make it solely optional as you could expect when turning on ""Shake to Start"".

Do you guys have a solution for any of the above issues?

458,Dry-Instruction-423,"Hello!  I started using my Apple Watch series 8 to track my sleep with an app called ""SleepWatch."" - Using the premium version of app.

Issue: For some reason or another, my respiratory rate is not being captured. On both my iPhone 14 Pro and watch, the setting to track respiratory rate in enabled. 

What I have done:

1. This morning, I updated my apple watch. To 9.3.1 - could that have been the issue?
2. Restarted both my devices.

I have read a few posts about people having to reset their watches to get this to work. Hoping I can avoid this and it happened to be my watch was not up to date. I am eager to track this data and kind bummed it didn't work. Does it take a couple night? Thanks!

4) series 7 - 45mm - BLUE - 165 charging cycles (98%) - little scratched (used).. (for 305$) - really dont wanna big watches (so idk if this is good)

My ideal price is 315$

462,ohyeahns,"Hi, I am looking for a way to simplify things.

To prevent my family waking up with me at 5:50 AM, I sleep with the watch on in a silent mode, so the alarm vibrates on my wrist. Super nice way to be woken up actually.

To prevent potential harmful effect of wifi and BT on my body (debatable), I use flight mode with a hard wifi and BT disable in the settings (otherwise it only disconnects, but stays on). This will disconnect watch and iphone, so the iphone thinks there is no watch anymore and the alarm goes off in the morning on both devices.

btw Wifi is manually disabled in the settings on my watch all the time to spare the battery - it is connected to the phone so why to have it on anyway? Right?

&amp;#x200B;

So the sequence in the bed:

* Flight mode on the watch
* Sleep mode on the watch
* Manual disable bluetooth on the watch
* Flight mode on the iphone
* Sleep settings - disable alarm manually (several steps and clicks)

I was playing with my friend's watch the other day, and it interpreted the EKG as showing afib. Yesterday I had to call an ambulance (another heart related issue) and I mentioned that to them, they said there was no sign of afib at that moment, but their experience was that sometimes if a sinus arrhythmia is particularly bad, that it will read that as afib. He was pretty sure that you could change the settings somehow, so that the watch knew not to be so ""sensitive"" when reading my results.

There was no actual sign of afib on the readings my friend's watch either. \[I asked about it here.\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadMyECG/comments/11a6ipf/should\_i\_be\_worried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadMyECG/comments/11a6ipf/should_i_be_worried/))

I primarily use my series 2 for fitness tracking and timing starts of races for sailing. I was on Fitbit for years, but decided to give an old Apple Watch a try this past summer. I‚Äôm definitely not going back to Fitbit!

The series 2 was purchased used and cheap to see if I would like it. It works okay most of the time, but the battery has seen better days. It loses its charge easily, especially if I track a workout. I‚Äôve stopped tracking any workout on the watch and it now makes it through most of the day without dying. I don‚Äôt mind this, as I‚Äôm a runner so I use Strava anyway. Sometimes it decides it doesn‚Äôt want to charge at all. 

The battery is my main complaint. I would love some opinions on if the SE is worth upgrading based on battery life and using it for fitness/calorie tracking.

My question is, why will the number to his watch not ring if the phone is even remotely nearby? Every time I call his watch number when the phone is close, it will go straight to a message saying the voice mail is not set up.

However if I call the number for the phone to which the watch is paired, which is sitting right here on my desk, it will ring to the watch.

Is this working as intended? Because if I am paying money for a separate phone number, I would like it to ring the watch at all times, not depend on whether the mobile phone is close by or not.

I used the Express Replacement option. They did place a hold on my charge card for the full cost of the replacement ($800 for an S5 Ti!). I received the watch in one day. The only hassle here was it required a signature, and I could not redirect it to a FedEx center.

The replacement watch had the original WatchOS, so it took multiple updates to get it to pair to my phone (read as a long time!). 

In the back of my mind, I was hoping to get a newer SBTi since I thought there were not that many out there, however, my replacement one is an S5.

Of note, my original owner S3 still shows a Battery Health of 95% (I switch watches for sleep tracking, etc.). My girlfriend's S5 has a battery health of 74%, and we are deciding to either replace the battery or upgrade it.

We hope by reducing the margin of error at the start will help our family have a smooth start with the watch. If they want more functions later on, we are game to add them, we just don't want to overwhelm at the start.

It turns out it's not that straightforward with carrier websites providing very little information, unclear limitations on which countries the service works and lack of knowledge from the staff.  
This past 2 days, I've been trying to help a friend from the US whose kid wasn't able to call her from her Apple Watch while in Europe, and I found that carriers are approaching this feature in different ways.  
I'll share what I learned from AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the US, but also found some interesting discussions on carriers from Europe and Asia. Feel free to share your experience and learnings in this thread.  


**(USA - AT&amp;T) - Roaming on wearables only works natively in Canada and Mexico (Feb 2023)**

[*https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1182926/*](https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1182926/)

*The Unlimited Your Way plans now include international long-distance calling to Canada and Mexico from wearable devices that support cellular service at no additional charge. For Series 5 and higher Apple¬Æ wearables (WatchOS 9.1 or higher required ), the rate plans now also include at no additional charge:*

* *Using data and sending iMessages while in Mexico and Canada.*
* *Talk in and between Mexico and Canada and from Mexico and Canada to the United States.*
   * *Connect your wearable to a VoLTE cellular network in Mexico and Canada directly, without needing your smartphone nearby*

***FYI:*** *For travel with an Apple wearable outside of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, continue to use your smartphone cellular connection or Wi-Fi.*

There is a service called **NumberSync** that allows you to manage multiple lines, including wearables and cars, but is limited to domestic (US bound) use.

[*https://www.att.com/support/smallbusiness/article/smb-wireless/KM1225754/*](https://www.att.com/support/smallbusiness/article/smb-wireless/KM1225754/)  
*Apple Watch (GPS + Cellular) does not support domestic or international cellular roaming.*

My friend spend a couple of hours with AT&amp;T representatives on the phone, at first they said roaming would work just fine in Europe, but then tried to put the blame on the Watch saying that wearables technology was ""iffy"". Not much of a help.  


**(USA - T-Mobile) - Roaming on wearables available through a DIGITS account (Feb 2023)**

I'm a T-Mobile customer and have used their roaming worldwide for the past 9 years on my phone. No detailed information available on their websites regarding wearables, but I reached out to a representative.

It seems global roaming is available through their DIGITS service, which enables cellular (talking) capabilities over data, with their ""Data with paired DIGITS"" plan:

 [*https://www.t-mobile.com/apps/t-mobile-digits*](https://www.t-mobile.com/apps/t-mobile-digits)

Here's what the representative wrote:

*As we discussed, we have Data with paired DIGITS plans where in All international roaming calls and text are billed at the standard international rates for Simple Global and International data roaming is unlimited at 128kbps (Simple Global features)*

*Also, Adding a watch line will cost you $10 with autopay per month*

*You may rely on this helpful link to add a new watch line for your Apple device*

*SoftBank Corp. is thrilled to offer, on its ‚ÄúSoftBank‚Äù mobile service brand, International Roaming for the new Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation), with groundbreaking technology and performance, and Apple Watch Ultra with a revolutionary new design and breakthrough capabilities.*

*Starting November 10, 2022, SoftBank Corp. is offering international roaming for Apple Watch. With international roaming for Apple Watch, users can stay connected to a cellular network while traveling abroad simply by extending their iPhone roaming plan to Apple Watch.*

&amp;#x200B;

It seems things are not that clear in Europe either, I found some threads that mentioned UK Vodafone not being clear on the services provided.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps and gives people a starting point on their research. It's an incredible feature for parents who want to be sure their kids are safe and reachable when traveling abroad, or even helpful for a morning run when you don't want to carry your phone.Apple Watch Cellular Roaming - Not that easy (Carriers and countries experiences)",0,AppleWatch

785,SoulHound,"I bought the SE2 for over a month now. I had no problems with it during the 1st month of use. It was super useful when I travelled abroad and had to use navigation apps for transport.

I was coming from a fitbit which I occasionally still use. The main reason I bought the SE2 was for more data when running, receiving notifications/reminders and being able to leave my phone when doing short errands. I never used AOD on my fitbit inspire 3.

Comparing with the series 8, I didn't want to spend an additional $200 to get it (that's the additional cost in my country). However, I didn't even consider or know that I would not be getting an Always-On Display in my SE2. I was browsing through the internet and it convinced me that having AOD is essential!

I bought SE2 with apple care+ (it's my first time buying a watch and I thought it's good investment to have an insurance since a watch is something that's always exposed instead of keeping in the pockets like an iPhone) which would be the same price as the Series 7 (but without apple care+). But the only colors available in stores near me are red and green which I really don't like. I don't imagine myself wearing a red watch and strap while wearing a blue suit.

Did I make a mistake for opting with the SE2 instead of spending an additional $200 to get the Series 8 with AOD? I don't need the keyboard, extra sensors, or fast charging. Just AOD. Would it be worth the extra $200?

Also, should I have just got the series 7 without apple care+ and just ""endured"" looking at the watch or should've just put it in a case??Is Buying an Apple Watch SE 2022 a mistake?",0,AppleWatch
786,noneofthefoxes,"At the risk of being banned from the subreddit, I have to ask. Why should I get the Apple Watch specifically? It seems like there's only people who like Android watches and Apple watches. I want to know, which one do I needt?

I have an iPhone and a Macbook and I want a watch but I don't need everything it offers. What I need is something to let me know who's calling, who's sending a message, how's my heart, what my step count is and that's that. Maybe I also like Apple's thing of detecting car accidents and falling and notifying 911 and all that. 

Other than that... I'm certainly not going to type on it with my fingers that are already too big for my iPhone keyboard. 

I'm sorry if this is extremely off-topic. I just feel so out of touch with this technology and I'm barely in my early thirties. Let me know where I can ask these questions because the /r/smartwatch subreddit is shit. Thanks.Need advice/direction on buying a smart watch",0,AppleWatch

795,LordGorzul,"\-Suddenly, Watch 5 will not update the software.   
Asking it to do it does nothing, eventually it freezes the watch and it goes into a reset loop before downloading the software.

\-Iphone no longer paired with the watch, impossible to pair them, they just wont see each other.   
Same internet, wifis on etc. 

\-Watch often locks, battery sometimes deplets by 30% in an instant when trying to reset it, or pair it.

\-Resetting the watch doesnt work. ""erase all data"" does nothing. 

\-When on charger watch restarts every 10 min or so by itself. 

\-Hard restart (crown+side button for 10s) solves nothing.

Im really at a loss as to what to do. I am trying to reset the watch to factory settings, how can I do that? Cant do it via phone since it cannot be paired, and doing it on the watch does nothing.

798,Zynix-,"Hey all. 
Every time I hit the gym, my Apple Watch shows that I'm burning over 1000 calories per session of resistance training. And when I do dumbbell walking lunges, my watch always registers a peak heartbeat of over 200! Like for instance yesterday, when I did this exercise, it measured 210 beats at max. This just seem insane to me even though I'm pushing myself to the limits. Is it really possible to burn that many calories in 1 hour of weightlifting or is my watch just trolling me? And what about the heart rate?

Key points:

- I'm a 24 year old male

-  I usually do resistance training for 60-80 mins, it depends on what day it is. For example on Legday, I do 5x5 Squat with 4-5 minute breaks between each set.

- My resting rate is 70

- I don't use nicotine products

- I drink coffee and PWO before working out

809,GarrettSucks,"So my friends and I want to do completions every week because we go to the same gym and do the same program every day. But there‚Äôs a really annoying quirk to the fitness competitions. 

Anytime you invite someone to one, it starts the next day. So if you invite on Saturday, it starts on Sunday goes until midnight the next Saturday. 

But you can‚Äôt invite to another one until that one ends that next Saturday at midnight. So then you have to invite to the next one at 12:01 on Sunday, but because of this it won‚Äôt start until Monday and then it will go until the next Sunday. Then you won‚Äôt be able to invite until the next Monday and it will start on Tuesday. So on and so forth. 

So every week, they continually will be pushed a day. It‚Äôs kind of annoying because I like when they are evenly for one whole 5 day week of workouts and would love to always have them Sunday to Saturday. But because you can‚Äôt invite to a new completion until one ends, it‚Äôs not possible.

This also seems to happen with alarms from the Clock app, if my Watch is set to mirror Clock alarms from my phone.

I think the only way around this is to turn off the automatic sleep schedule on my iPhone, use a regular alarm, and set the Clock app on my Watch to not mirror notifications from my phone.

So I'll go to work in the morning wearing my normal clothes including a fully-charged Apple Watch, change into my assigned 1950s (or 1970s or...) outfit and **remove the Apple Watch since it's not period-appropriate**. I leave my Watch with the Wardrobe department along with the rest of my regular clothes - sitting in a jacket pocket in a garment bag. At the end of the workday I return to Wardrobe and change back into my regular clothes, put my Apple Watch back on..and discover the battery has gone dead or is nearly so - I don't have the use of the watch for my return commute back home.

My *guess* is the watch goes crazy with the active sensors and that's what eats up the battery. I think it wakes up, tries to record heartrate or body temperature or wrist presence or some such using those little red lights on the back but when it can't get a reading (because it's not on a wrist) it just tries again and again and again (possibly upping the power level in case that might help) until the battery dies. 

Or maybe it's network stuff! In that case the issue is that it tries to connect via Bluetooth to my usually-present iPhone or tries to connect via wifi (it's a wifi-only watch) to some usually-present network but can't find the connections it expects so bumps up the power and checking frequency trying to resolve matters there on the assumption that I might have important text messages coming in that mustn't be missed...until the battery dies.

Anyway, my EXPECTED behavior is that a watch I'm not wearing should pretty quickly NOTICE it's not moving at all and isn't on a wrist and go to sleep and use LESS battery than if I kept wearing it, but the ACTUAL behavior is that it instead does SOMETHING that uses up all the battery. I could stop to manually power off the watch every time I leave it behind and power it back on later but that's kind of a pain.

[https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/](https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/)

I've been testing this a lot lately and ultimately trying to determine if the Workoutdoors app causes additional battery drain when running it in map only mode in the background. 

 I haven't got to that part of my testing yet, but with the Apple Workout app alone the best I'm seeing is a 1% drop every 10 minutes, so 6% per hour.  I always use a Wahoo BTLE chest strap for my HR measurements too, but this has made no difference in my testing compared to the wrist sensor in the watch. When I have low power mode on, and regardless if I use the chest strap, or if I have the 'fewer gps/hr setting enabled', I still get the same 1% drop every 10 minutes.

6% per hour is almost the 17 hours of usage that Apple claims. However, if I have my phone with me (so LTE data isn't being used by the watch), and I have low power and 'fewer gps readings enabled', I should be seeing better than 1 hours, right?

She had previously had a heart attack and has has been diagnosed with aFib. Part of my concern is that sometimes she feels 'funny' and isn't sure if that's aFib or not so she does nothing and waits it out. 

Last night she woke up feeling 'funny' and took an ECG with her watch, and was notified that she was in aFib. With that confirmation she got up and drove herself to the hospital (Grr. We are discussing that.) Hospital confirmed aFib and began treating her and were able to get it under control. They sent her home a few hours later (although wouldn't let her drive so she took a taxi and she was salty about that). She finally called me when she got home. (Grr again). 

But wanted to share an Apple Watch win! Without the watch confirmation I doubt she would have taken herself to the hospital.

1075,HatesVanityPlates,"I'm recently back from eight days of sailing in the USVI, including a lot of snorkeling. I've been using my Ultra and the Workout app to track pool swims since I got it, but this was my first chance to get in the ocean.

First, I made Oceanic+ a complication on my watch face. I didn't want to give over the shortcut button to it, because I also wanted to record open water swim workouts while I snorkeled and I have Workout as my shortcut. Naturally, I would occasionally look at my watch and see that it thought I was snorkeling when I was actually driving the boat, or making breakfast, or whatever, because I tend to accidentally hit the complications. Can't be helped.

When it was time to snorkel, I got my gear on and jumped in the water, then told workout to record an open water swim and told Oceanic+ to record snorkeling. Oceanic+ turned on the water lock automatically, so I could not accidentally interfere with it as I swam.

My various snorkel explorations ranged from 15 minutes to more than an hour. Oceanic+ recorded date and time, location, minimum water temperature, how many times I made surface dives, and my maximum depth (a pathetic 10 feet). I can add water condition ratings and notes to each session.

The display was easy to read, and I really liked being able to know at a glance how long I'd been out. I might try using Oceanic+ on my next pool swim to see if the pool's thermometor is accurate :-)

Also, I noted that despite running both Oceanic+ and Workout at the same time, battery life was not significantly impacted.

Hi everyone, happy to say we are starting to allow the first beta testers into the closed version 2 of Motion.

As a fellow apple fitness plus user, I can understand where it thrives and where there is more to desire.

What does Motion do?

**Data-based personalised goals-** Each user will receive a personalised weekly goal in the form of one simple score. The choice to go weekly is to allow for rest days which challenging ring targets do not. Upon sign-up, Motion analyses your recent activity data to find what you complete in an average week. From this, our algorithm calculates a weekly goal which will cause you to improve against your average levels of activity.

**Compatibility-** I know many of you will have friends with Fitbits, Garmins etc so we made Motion compatible with any smartwatch and available on IOS or Android.

**Activa tars-** Earning the badges etc is a fun way to stay engaged, but to improve on this further we have added your very own Activity Avatar (Activatar). These have the ability to be levelled up through you hitting your goal and will show emotion during the week depending on whether you are on track.

You might be thinking what's the catch? How is it free?

To be transparent, although V1 was successful we are still a relatively new startup and are just trying to grow our user base and provide value before thinking of monetising.

The link to the waitlist can be found here: [www.motion-app.com](https://www.motion-app.com/)

Very happy to answer any questions tooI saw another mention of how apple expects you to be active 365 days a year. Please check this post if you are interested in being closed beta tester for a free fitness app which provides you with a personalised weekly goal based on your historic averages",0,AppleWatch

I lost my sleep stage data for 1 day. This is the 2nd time where I had schedules set up and woke up turned off sleep mode and there was no sleep data.

I think I had this before but it somehow automatically resolved itself so I didnt think much of it.

But this happened again.

I believe this has something to do with setting sleep mode ON through the Control Panel of Iphone rather than turning on Sleep Mode through the Apple Watch.

1145,buhzainer,"I purchased the Series 7 last year and contemplating an upgrade to the Ultra. Unfortunately none of the straps I currently have for the Series 7 (45mm) will fit the Ultra (49mm). I have a couple nicer straps for the Series 7 (Hermes, Milanese, and 3rd party) that I feel dress the watch up. So I am contemplating keeping the Series 7 instead of trading it in so I can still wear it for nicer occasions. 

My question is, what type of maintenance/care do I need to implement for the Series 7 if it is going to go extended periods (month or so) without being worn? From what I have read if it sits uncharged for a while it might lose its ability to hold a charge and/or not turn on.

Then onto accuracy, my main interest is running, always needed a chest strap with Garmin, I discovered apple is accurate enough without a strap, GPS is also much better on Apple than any of the Garmins I had.

And I only just updated my iCloud storage to 2TB So it's even more of a kick to the nuts that that boot loop issue had to even happen right then and there! Because of the reliance on the phone, I have no way to save everything I've done up until now unless I try to find a way to have it update through other means. I doubt finding a third party tech support would help so I'm pretty much SOL even more!Is there a way to save data an Apple Watch that couldn't reconnect with an iPhone?",0,AppleWatch
1429,Siosal01,"Hey all. I recently joined the Apple family after more than a decade on Android. With my phone, I got a 45mm series 8. The battery has been fine so far, getting around 2 days (activity dependent). However I just decided to try out low power mode and I'm not sure if something is wrong or not, as I unplugged it at 100% 2 hours ago, immediately switched on low power mode and I'm already at 92%. 

I've rebooted the watch to see if that makes a difference but I'd like to know from the community what I should be expecting.

1500,sullf,"Hi, Apple Watch community,   
My name is Fred Sullivan and I am one of the founders of Motion.  
From being a long-term Reddit user, I too do not enjoy seeing ads everywhere. However, we have been working extremely hard on the new version of Motion and I want it to help as many people as possible increase their likelihood of reaching their fitness goals.  


Right, now onto the exciting stuff.   


Motion is an activity-tracking app which main purpose is to increase your activity levels as a whole. The app is available on IOS or Android along with being compatible with any smartwatch  


The app is still 100% free with zero advertisements or 3rd party tracking. If you are wondering how we make money, at this point we don‚Äôt. We are still an early-stage startup looking to build an audience that can provide valuable feedback.  


**So what is Motion and what can it do for you and your friends/family?**  


**Data-based goals.**  
We analyse your past activity data including steps. workouts and calories burned to find your ‚Äúaverage week‚Äù Based on this, we then set you a weekly goal to improve against your historic average activity levels.  
Our algorithm simplifies the data into one clear number which will increase/decrease each week depending on whether you hit your goal or not.   
Weekly goals compared to ring closing gives you more of an opportunity to have a rest day or just a day off when life gets in the way.  
**Sharing.**  
Due to compatibility with **any** smartwatch, this means you can share with **any** friend or family member.  
This can be done by simply adding friends or by creating teams. Each other‚Äôs workouts will be displayed in the feed allowing for encouragement and accountability.  
Due to the personalised goal being based on your data, it means then instead of comparing times and distance you can simply encourage people to achieve their own goals.  


**Activatars.**  
We have created your own Activity Avatar (Activatar) to provide a layer of fun when hitting your activity goals.  
These Activatars will show emotion throughout the week (also available as a widget on the home screen)¬† depending on whether you are on track to hit your goal.  
In addition to this, upon hitting your goal you will start to unlock ‚Äòshakes‚Äô which can be used to level up and evolve your Activatar. These will then be shareable with your friends too.  


I am aware that when someone offers something for free it can be seen as too good to be true.  
In this case, the app is still genuinely free.

Of course, there will be a point in the future when we may add a freemium model, but being transparent we still have no plan to do this anytime soon.

From version 1 we had a great user base of apple watch users who loved the app. We are just trying to build on this with V2 and make an app people get a lot of benefit and enjoyment from.  


**Sounds like it would be great for you.**  


We will be releasing V2 from **next week**  
All you have to do is sign up through this link to receive your access code:  
[www.motion-app.com/v2](http://www.motion-app.com/v2)

I‚Äôm not dismissing the notifications either, I felt one on my watch so instead of checking it, I went strait to my phone to check there and it wasn‚Äôt there. I had not seen the message, it just disappeared because I didn‚Äôt check my watch fast enough.

1519,amrungwaew,"I don‚Äôt know if this is allowed, so my peremptory apologies if it isn‚Äôt. 

I got an S6 (GPS) a year ago but honestly haven‚Äôt used it as much as I probably should‚Äîthe main issue is that the battery only lasts ~20 hours on my wrist so I have to charge it daily and forget about putting it back on (plus I keep taking it off to cook or something and then forget about it). Anyway, that‚Äôs my Apple Watch background. 

About 3 months ago, I had a mild but fairly terrifying medical scare due to some medication issues where I had a dangerously high heart rate and some afib. I knew something was wrong but it wasn‚Äôt until I checked my heart rate with the watch that I realised what exactly was wrong. So, yay Apple Watch for that!

Okay, now on to the actual meaningful content. I am wondering if and how people have utilised the Apple Watch with regards to monitoring/counteracting extreme anxiety and stress. I am medically diagnosed with anxiety and I‚Äôm so constantly feeling stressed that it‚Äôs just the status quo for me. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt great for my mental or physical health and I always have headaches and extreme tension throughout my muscles. I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is if people have found the Apple Watch useful for alerting themselves about the physiological symptoms of stress and anxiety in order to try to be proactive about combatting it (whether meditation or yoga or whatever). My anxiety includes panic attacks, which aren‚Äôt any fun, but I‚Äôm usually to fixated on what‚Äôs going on externally that it never quite registers how extreme my body‚Äôs response is. 

I feel like there‚Äôs a way to make the watch a lot more useful to be more tuned in with the signs of extreme stress and anxiety, but I don‚Äôt know what that is‚Ä¶ Of course I‚Äôm also working with a psychiatrist and a therapist, but I‚Äôm trying to be more proactive about my health and investing in ways to help myself out.

Sorry for the rambly post!

TL;DR: is there a way to monitor physiological symptoms to alert the wearer that they‚Äôre experiencing high stress/anxiety or panic attacs? &amp; would it be worth upgrading to a newer watch to take advantage of such?

I see Apple doesn‚Äôt even fix the watch if water damage is found within the warranty period. This is kind of baffling to me. If it‚Äôs meant to be in water surely they would cover it in the warranty? This seems like false advertising to me. If there‚Äôs a good chance water will destroy it, good enough that they won‚Äôt cover it under warranty, how can they possibly say it‚Äôs meant for swimming? I feel like there should be a class action lawsuit for this. Before you all tell me how much you swim with yours, I‚Äôd just like to reiterate, it‚Äôs not covered under warranty and you‚Äôre playing roulette with it every time you go in the water. The repair cost, from what I‚Äôve read, will cost nearly as much as a new watch. It‚Äôs just over 2 years old and dead. I‚Äôm completely in the Apple ecosystem and extremely disappointed. My Garmin watch that cost half as much never failed me in any way. This kind of loss, Apple's lack of warranty covered indicating they know it‚Äôs not suitable for swimming, and the obscene repair cost on an already ultra-expensive watch, has me wanting to get out of the Apple ecosystem entirely.

When you're working out, the default always goes to the workout app. This is frustrating when you're trying to focus on a workout and slightly derails the workout itself.

There's two stages to this:

A) The Apple Watch functions as normal for awhile. That's okay with me.

B) When you get to actually working out and an Apple Watch senses this, the Apple Watch starts defaulting on screen to the workout app. 

Part B is where workouts get distracted.

Example: If I am on 5k run, every time I go to switch songs to a new track that's motivational, I've got to go through a series of steps to get to the music app. The workout app always comes up as the default when I touch the Apple Watch.

1600,n1ght0wI,"Hey guys,

First of all, I expect this will probably get downvoted, because of how trivial my question is. While I am aware that AWU was explicitly also designed to be water resistant up to 100m - I have never, ever, went into water with an electronic gadget. However, I going to Spa tomorrow, and I am deciding to purchase Oceanic Band and give it my 'first'.   


I came here to Reddit to ask those, who will be willing to share their experience with having AWU inside Swimming Pools.  Here are my newbie questions:

1. Do I need to setup some Mode before I go into water?
2. Is it OK to be in water that are more warmer (28-32 degrees)? 
3. Does the Chloride that is used in our swimming pools, damage the AWU?
4. How long can I be in water with my AWU? In Spas I don't usually just swim, but I am in water for a prolonged time, relaxing. 
5. When I get out, I have to do some 'water clear' process. Does it trigger automatically on AWU? Is this reliable enough to just run it, and trust it is OK?
6. Finally, what is your experience with other AWs throughout the years. If you use them few times a year in Swimming Pools / Sea .. will the watch degrade faster (battery, corrosion, some mechanical issues,..)?  


I do apologies for the trivial questions, as I know most will point me to the fact it is built water resistant, but since I am literally 'afraid' of using electronics in water (damage the device or hurt potentially myself) - I would like to beat this fear for the first time, with your help.Using AWU in swimming pools",0,AppleWatch

1609,Major_Foster,"Despite it working perfectly for more than 2 years, the last few months I'm having a lot of problems with Apple Watch and music.  I traditionally only select a single playlist of 1000 songs to be put on  the Watch (SE1), but since 9.0 or 9.1 (don't know for sure)  it keeps on downloading songs (a lot more than those 1000) until it  eventually tells me the Watch is full. During the transfer of all those  songs the battery drain (both on Watch and iPhone) is enormous. Anybody  else experiences this too?

When I deselect the playlist to be put on the Watch (in the iPhone Watch app), the number of songs on the Watch stays exactly the same. This is also very strange, because with no music selected it should be 0, right, and all music should be erased? Only when I reselect the playlist it briefly goes back to 0, but then it starts downloading all the songs again (and a lot more).

Something else that seems off to me is when I go into 'Music' in the  'Settings' on the Apple Watch itself (not on iPhone), I can't switch of  the first option ('add playlist songs' or something like that). When I  switch it off and go back, it's switched on again. Is anybody able to  switch off the first option? Maybe this causes the problem? Maybe this means it downloads all the available playlists from my iPhone on the Watch, and not only the one I selected?

I'm on 9.3 now and nothing changed. I want to hear if other people experience the exact same problem? Because the last few months a lot of people seem to have problems with Apple Watch and music, but the problems differ a lot.

I have an Apple Watch Ultra and a Series 7. Recently (last 2 months or so) I have gotten into running pretty regularly. 

When I first got my Ultra it was activated using my series 7 back up.

(Other than cycling which I had used Garmin for I never did much out workout wise with the 7). 

Flash forward to now. I have used my series 7 on a few runs and it is under reporting known distances up to about 1/4 mile sometimes more.

1654,shuffles03,"Hey all,

I‚Äôm a current owner of a Garmin Fenix 6X (nearly two years). I‚Äôm not an ultra marathon runner or trek enthusiast etc etc - I wanted a large watch that tracked everything I did. And, at the time, the Fenix 6X fit the bill.

Two years later, I‚Äôm hovering over purchasing an Apple Watch Ultra (with the yellow ocean band) and selling the Fenix.

I love the size and I also use a MacBook Pro, iPhone and AirPods Pro.

My girlfriend and brother both have Apple Watches (Series 3 and 6) and I‚Äôve watched how the watch seamlessly exists in their life, connecting from Mac to iPad, answering calls to closing rings etc.

I‚Äôm curious to hear if anyone else made the switch from a similar Garmin device and what their thoughts were? Someone who is into fitness but not an enthusiast I suppose.

Garmin Connect is so feature rich but then at the same time, as I‚Äôm not a professional athlete a lot of the metrics (Training Status, Body Battery etc) are probably wasted on me - sure they‚Äôre cool to look at but as my girlfriend pointed out, closing her rings is so much fun üòÇ.

I generally get about 3-4 weeks of battery life which is awesome and great to shout from the rooftops. However, as I‚Äôm not an ultra marathoner and won‚Äôt be stranded in the middle of nowhere for days on end, I feel as though the added battery is more of a convenience tbh.

I don't like to have a bunch of apps installed to do different things and would like to keep it as stock as possible. That's why I'm wondering if it's in some way bad if I use the ""outdoor run"" workout option for skiing instead. Does this mess up the watch's calibration since of course skiing is much faster than running?

I've also looked at sports tracker as an alternative for this but once again I would like to keep it as stock as possible whilst I still would like to measure distance.

Does anybody else have tried something like this, I have had the ultra with a data plan just for a couple of days and so far:

Pros: 
- I love the refreshing feeling of not taking my phone
- The main things I want work great (music, calls, messages, payments ‚Ä¶)
- Messages and dictation works amazingly well, way better than in other Apple Watches
- Battery is much better


Cons:
- it seems not possible to do anything with the watch while in a FaceTime call, I tried to pay while in a call and Apple Pay was not triggered!
- some basic support to preview pdfs or something would be great (I.e checking an email)
- charging seems very slow, not sure if where I plugged it but seems to take ages, anyone has any references?
- it‚Äôs design is questionable, some angles looks great, others it simply looks bulky
- Lack of app support, like Google‚Äôs authenticator, Revolut and others require the phone to login ‚Ä¶


Anybody else can share any experience or tricks?, any favourite apps?, how do you handle the charging through to make the most considering using mobile data will drain it quicker?Apple Watch ultra with no phone",0,AppleWatch

1741,n1ght0wI,"Hey guys,

I own AWU with a Trail Loop which I enjoy. However, when I workout, I try to tighten it a bit more. And when I go to sleep I try to wear ti more lose than during the day. So basically, I have to adjust it  3x a day and what I struggle with is, that with such band, there are no holes which you could memorize. When I had Garmin Epix2, it was really cool to adjust the band, just by counting the holes (once I figured out tightness for each activity).  


I am really stressed whether it is too tight for daily use, or too tight for sleep. It does not necessary feel tight at the moment I adjust, but having it throughout the night.. sometimes I see more intense 'marks' after removing the watch, and sometimes it is alright. 

  
I wish I had a technique with this band to memorize how to put it, but can't find a way. 

I consider purchasing Spigen's Rugged Band, which seems to be most similar  to Epix2 (which I loved), but that one might have issues, because it is not originally for AWU.  Hence I am here, if some of you found a nice way to memorize the adjustments.How do you adjust tightness with Trail Loop on AWU?",0,AppleWatch

1755,urcrain,"There‚Äôs no doubting that the Apple Watch has plenty of features and methods of collecting data. Heart rates, ECG, blood oxygen levels, running forms, hearing data, temperature measurements, and much more. This data that being collected is unlike the data being collected is far more than what smartphones can collect as it benefits from sitting on the users wrist in direct contact with their skin. 

The problem is that Apple collects all of this data, and instead of utilising the data in a meaningful way, just throws it all into the health application where the user can attempt to analyse the data on their own, or download plenty of third party applications that will make use of your data, typically accompanied by a mandatory subscription. The only real interaction that apple communicates with users regarding their data is the occasional notification regarding trends, and some health alerts such as loud environmental noise or a high heart rate. 

If you look at the competition, you can see how other companies like Garmim and Samsung collects less data but manages to implement features that manage to communicate important information directly with the user. This, because it‚Äôs done directly by them and has to go through vigorous tests, tends to be more accurate than third party apps as well as being completely free. You will see how if you wanted similar functionality on the Apple Watch, you‚Äôd have to spend a fortune. 

Functionality that the Apple Watch is missing but competitions have is as follow:

# Stress level monitoring
On the Samsung watch, you can see the levels of stress throughout your day and can be notified to take a moment if your stress levels are high. This uses HRV levels to do this.

The closest thing you can get to this on Apple Watch is an app called Stress Detector, which costs ¬£49.99 per year. 

# Readiness Score/Fitness recovery times
Garmin uses your data (HRV along with other info) to estimate how ready you are so you can avoid over working out or being too idle. A low score indicates a score of you having to relax, and a high score means you are ready for anything. 

The closest apps you can get to this is training today, which is ¬£15 per year, or Gentle Streak, which is ¬£50 per year. 

# Sleep Results
Garmin gives personalised recommendations based on your sleeping habits. If you don‚Äôt sleep enough, it will notify you encouraging you to sleep more. If it notices anything abnormal during your sleep, it will also notify you. It can tell you if your body didn‚Äôt actually rest properly even if you feel fine, letting you plan ahead and reduce burning out your body. 

Not aware of any apps that work like this. Auto sleep gives some decent info but no where as near as the level that Garmin does. All apple does is tell you that you reached your goal, and doesn‚Äôt even tell you if you didn‚Äôt.

# Snore Detection
The Samsung watch can detect you snoring. Very simple stuff, but can snoring can be a good indication of sleep apnea.

Best app for this is Sleep Cycle, which costs ¬£35 per year. 

# Sleep Apnea Detection
The Samsung watch can detect Sleep Apnea by monitoring your blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and respiratory rate. You could go to the health app on iPhone and analyses the data yourself, but you can‚Äôt see it all on one screen so you‚Äôd have to jump back and forth. For your average consumer, doing this on their own isn‚Äôt feasible. 

You can get NapBot for detecting sleep apnea for ¬£10 per year. 

# Step Tracking
This is a little nick-Pick but let‚Äôs say your day to day life doesn‚Äôt revolve comfortably around closing your rings every day and you prefer to walk. Some people prefer tracking your steps, but unfortunately Apple has no complications to track your number of steps, and the only way to see them is to open the fitness app and scroll down until you see your steps. No notifications or indication of your progress. Garmim and Samsung let you see this data if you want, but Apple insists on using their rings. 

If you want to track your steps, then StepsApp Pedometer is your best shot, costing ¬£20 per year

#### Summary 
As you can see, doing all of this would cost a lot of money and require many individual apps from companies that could delete them at any moment. The data is there, but apple is simply deciding to dump it all into the health app rather than focusing on the benefits that the data could be used for. Apple is already working on the next hardware innovation, but is not focusing on the software side of things.The data that Apple manages to collect through their innovative feature set is impressive, but isn‚Äôt being utilised as much as it could be",0,AppleWatch

1763,CD_4M,"Hi everyone, this may be a dumb question but I'm new to Apple Watch and haven't been able to find this question in the sub yet. 

The Fitness app will use calories burned as the overall measure of your workout in terms of intensity or performance. And as I understand it, the number of calories burned is largely determined based on your heart rate. 

This makes me wonder, as I get more in shape I should have to work progressively harder to elevate my heart rate and keep it elevated, right? So if for example when I first started working out with Apple Watch I rode a stationary bike at a set resistance level for 30mins and burned 300 calories. If I do that same workout with the same resistance every day for 2 months, it's going to get easier for me, and my heartrate won't be as high while doing it. So after 2 months of this same workout, is it likely that my Apple Watch will actually show me burning fewer calories with the same workout? And is it just the reality that you burn fewer calories if you don't increase the intensity of a workout as you get into better shape, or is it a limitation of the calorie tracking on Apple Watch? 

Thanks in advance!Calories Burned as Measure of Workout Intensity/Performance",0,AppleWatch

1849,4161608,"I have a heart condition that causes a high resting HR so it is very helpful to me to be able to track my resting heart rate with my watch.

However ever since I purchased the watch (about a month ago), i've noticed that it records extremely inaccurate readings. As in, it will occasionally record very low readings (50s, 60s and 70s, which I know is not low for others but is low for me as my resting HR rate is always 100-110) out of nowhere. I know that these are not accurate because I downloaded an app that can continuously monitor my HR, and I have never gotten a reading below 90. It is very rarely below 100. I know for a fact that a reading that low would be impossible for me, so I have no idea where they're coming from.

This is very annoying as the inaccurate readings completely mess up my chart and remove any possibility of me being able to track my heart rate accurately. I would simply keep the third party app running all the time, as it's pretty much 100% accurate, but it drains a lot of battery and means I can't use my watch for fitness reasons at the same time.

I have tried adjusting the tightness and everything but as my recordings are completely accurate on the third party app it seems to be an issue with apple's technology itself.

why is this happening? is there anything I can do to fix it?

instead, there are two separate sections in music on the watch, one to play music directly on the watch, and another that acts as an iphone remote. 

the two separate menus are almost exactly the same, except the iphone one doesn‚Äôt have search, which is quite inconvenient.

but what‚Äôs even more inconvenient is that if you start playing something on the watch, you can‚Äôt switch the output to the phone later. you have to stop the music, go into the separate iphone menu, and start the music again on the iphone separately. 

this also means that if you switch from watch to phone, you have to search the song you were listening to on the watch and start it again on the phone. there‚Äôs no continuity.

when i‚Äôm in the car, i want to start music from the watch, using the search function. this means i connect the watch directly to the cars stereo via bluetooth. problem is, if i start map directions, the voice now comes from the iphone‚Äôs speaker. 

the solution would be to connect the iphone to the car‚Äôs stereo instead of the watch, and only use the watch as a remote, but as said, the iphone remote section doesn‚Äôt have a search function.

again i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm missing something. but to me it should simply be: one music menu. you start the music, and then the little airplay icon should have the ability to change the destination to the iphone too, among the other devices. that‚Äôs it. i don‚Äôt see the reason for two separate menus.why isn‚Äôt music more unified with the iphone?",0,AppleWatch

Rebooting it didn't help, leaving the watch shut down for a whole night didn't help.

It used to burn 10% per hour, but now it's even using as little as 2-3% per hour (I'm an IT guy, I just sit behind a desk all day).

1934,realwoodbox,"I got the Apple watch to help with my heath.  It is an expensive accessory and some might think a bit of a gimmick for quite a bit of things.   I already had more than one watch that could tell the time.  The also were solar powered and had atomic sync capabilities so they were great in they were little to no maintenance that I could keep on all the time and not need to think about.

They however were not a smart watch like the iWatch and didn‚Äôt have any health tracking capabilities.

There were several features that I was interested in.  One was the core body temperature tracking.  I had classic covid in January 2020 before they even had a name for it and didn‚Äôt have any of the tests and everything else.   I was really sick for 2-3 weeks but want hospitalized so I guess I was lucky.  But post recovery has been tough and I am sure I have the long covid problems that many talk about.  One is that I am constantly feeling like I am burning up when I do any concentrated activity.  It‚Äôs far worse in the summer time but I goes on all year round.   The Apple iWatch series 8 with the temperature sensor intrigued me if it can record if my body core temperature is actually going up or down with these attacks so I had something to take with me to the doctor.   The Apple representative said yes, it needs to be worn for 5 nights to get a core body temperature but after that it will track the change in your core temperature change.  But that seems to be a bit of a BS stretch as it only checks the temperature average over the night time while you are sleeping and so is useless for my need.  In fact it‚Äôs a useless feature to anyone unless your female I guess and are tracking ovulation.   I am not.

Another core feature I wanted was  to help me when I misplace my iPhone.   I was told that as I have a newer iPhone with the U1 chip that the watch can be used to tell you accurately where your phone is.  Nope.  It was told it can give an arrow saying the phone is for example 10 feet away in that arrow pointing direction.   Well, I can‚Äôt see it.   The find my devices is is even worse than the iPhones one in it tells me what city it‚Äôs in but I already know that.  I know what house it‚Äôs in, but what I don‚Äôt know is where.

When looking around, the available options I have locally are:

* Used Apple Watch SE (gen 1) cellular for $200
* Used Apple Watch Series 5 cellular for $250
* New/refurbished Apple Watch Series 6 cellular for $300
* New Apple Watch SE (gen 2) cellular for $400

Is there any reason to prefer one model over the other? Other than the always on display on the non-SE models they all look more or less the same to me when I read about them. 

I kind of expect the watch to get scratches and perhaps even break eventually, even with a bumper case, so I don't want to spend too much on it. So for that reason an Apple Watch SE (get 1) in good condition looks like the most preferable option right now unless you can convince me otherwise.

For some reason Scribble is still not available for any of the Nordic languages and virtual keyboard is only available from Series 7 and upwards.

I've tried wearing the watch higher up on my wrist, but it is not very comfortable and it just wants to slide back down to my wrist anyways. From what I have read, the sensors are not designed to wear the watch on the underside of your wrist. It also seems like the option to just passcode lock the watch is not in the control center anymore.

I am not sure what to do at this point, as the watch is almost unusable for me for this kind of workout (which is probably 90% of what I do). Any recommendations?Apple Watch Ultra will not stay locked during workouts",0,AppleWatch
1995,DVSN_F,I didn‚Äôt think this full size keyboard on the watch would be useful. But it actually is. Way better than using dictation for me.,0,AppleWatch
