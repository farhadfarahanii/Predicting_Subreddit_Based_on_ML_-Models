A week ago I bought myself an Apple Watch 8 and I was really happy with a lot. However, I ran into a lot of difficulties that no one seems to be going to solve.

Well, firstly, I do not receive a notification about an incoming call from whatsapp, skype, telegram, viber, facebook messenger. I don't get any call notifications at all unless it's a phone call.

It surprises me that there is not a single blogger on YouTube who would raise this issue. It feels like people are afraid to speak publicly about the problems of Apple Watch.

Just got a call from her telling me that she decided not to buy it because ""my old one showed me my blood pressure and the Apple guy said that this doesn't do that. For the price I'm paying, it should show my blood pressure.""

I tried to explain to her that her old tracker didn't actually show her blood pressure, it just used a janky formula to try and infer it from her age, gender, heart rate and blood oxygenation. She was adamant that it was accurate because ""last time I was at the doctor, it was pretty close to his blood pressure cuff measurement"".

I asked her if she really thought that Apple would deliberately leave it off the watch if it was actually medically significant even though they have all the same sensors as her old tracker and a few more besides. She didn't have an answer beyond ""I want one that gives me my blood pressure.""

I typically hate comparing Apples and Androids but my Samsung Watch with Pixel phone would record the same data automatically with the native app, give an idea if something was in a typical range or not, and as an added bonus it did snore tracking/recording.

230,"First Apple mischaracterizes what ""Resting Heart Rate"" is.  It is the heart rate of the body when it is totally at rest, but not asleep. It is the base level for maintaining the machine.  It is the same all day.  Apple thinks it is the minimum heart rate at various periods during the day; that has very little bearing on the real RHR.  Moreover, it measures often when you are sitting doing something -=- like eating or working on the computer.  That requires energy to sit up, to move your hands, to think; it other words it raises your heart rate.  It's worthless until they start measuring only when you are truly ""at rest"" which means that your dominant hand hasn't moved in 5 minutes.Apple Watch Resting Heart Rate is a Bad Joke",0

Close your rings is for the subset of us that have the AW and the move more includes our AW-less friends and it‚Äôs just a step challenge. 

For the close your rings challenge, it asks for your weight to determine the move goal. Instead of pulling this from Apple Health, it just asks for manual entry and people can lie therefore having a much lower move goal. 

For the move more challenge, it pulls from Apple Health, however within Apple Health you can manually add steps to get the most points.  (And even if you make the move more challenge based on a move goal it ends up being the same cheating method of before)

So is there a group challenge app that will base weight on what‚Äôs in Apple Health and possibly also ignore manually added steps?

330,"Right, so for the past week I have experienced this bullshit error with both ‚Äúgreen snake of death‚Äù and ‚Äúred snake of death‚Äù on my Apple Watch Series 4. Like many of you who are probably reading this because you have the same issue, it occurred when connecting to the charger. I have fixed it now after replacing the battery but the error still showed with new battery fitted so my (inexperienced and amateur) opinion is that this is a software based issue which can be resolved by resetting the watch‚Äôs battery while connected to the charger. In depth details of my issue and how I solved it below, hopefully will help other people with this shitty fucking error. 

Some pre-context, my watch battery was clearly struggling to perform as would run out of battery very quickly through being used everyday since I owned it. I managed to check the battery health in the settings before I had the snake of death error and it showed 84% battery health. On the last day of it working in charged it as usual over night, put it on and it ran to 0% and turned off in &lt;45mins. 

I figured the battery was fried so I replaced it myself instead of having apple do it as I frequently repair my own tech. The job wasn‚Äôt easy but I managed to get it done and fitted a new battery and a Force Touch gasket as I split the original one when opening the case. 

Once the new battery was fitted I hoped this would fix the error but even then I still had the snake of death. I left it to charge overnight and came back in morning and the green snake error was still there. 

I then took it off the charger and let it run completely flat so nothing would come on screen (not even the red snake error). 

Then I put it back on the charger, green snake appeared again. I held the crown and side button for 15 secs to do a reset of the watch. (When I held the buttons the screen went to black and then flashed the snake error up again, when this happened I just continued to hold the buttons for the 15 sec count, put it down and left it there on charge.)

Walked by the watch about an hour later (maybe longer) and then a white exclamation mark appeared on the screen and went away without me touching the watch. 

The watch then showed the normal charging screen with red text and the time in bold as usually expected. It‚Äôs still charging back up to full now so will respond below in comments if it actually has 100% fixed my issue and if the error ever presents itself again in future. 

Apologies for lengthy essay but with this error I have had little to no details from the info I found online and thought documenting in full what happened with mine could help someone else. So my tip would be let the battery drain to completely flat and then charge it via an Apple branded charger directly through wall socket. Then count the 15 secs reset and leave it there and be patient and hopeful.Snake of Death error",0

Dislikes:

* Extra Ultra watch bands from Apple are expensive 
* Accidental button presses are common - (I flipped the orientation of the watch to avoid action button presses when bending my wrist)
* Size and depth of the watch catches on things frequently
* Action button could be more versatile  - For example, I'd love it to perform short cuts unless I'm in a workout and then I'd like it to perform splits or segments. 
* Limited to iPhone users only (only about 30% of the world wide market for smart phones) 
* Biking with the AWU isn't ideal.  I'd like to be able to connect my cycling radar and power meter.  

Likes:

* Lens and watch body durability has been exceptional 
* Display is bright and vibrant - (2000 nits is crazy bright)
* New running features are excellent (All Apple Watches) 
* Sounds quality is good
* Action button is somewhat customizable -  you can  set it to perform a short cut which can be customized on the iPhone app.
* Swimming with the AWU is ok.  I still wish they'd make a drill mode.

I recently started wearing my watch way more consistently and noticed my cardio stats are super low. I've also been dealing with some palpitations that are very scary and sometimes wake me up at night. 

I'm in the process of figuring this out with a cardiologist, but I feel like this Apple Watch is really giving me solid proof that there's something going on and it's not just my anxiety. 

My HRV has been hovering between 30-70 since I've worn the watch. Rarely, it will get to around 100 while I'm sleeping. Well, the other night my HRV jumped up to 229 while I was sleeping! The day before this happened, I went on a very long walk, took magnesium before bed, and used mouth tape while sleeping. 

Not really looking for advice, just sharing or wondering if anyone else's has gone that high. Of course, I googled if HRV can be ""too high"" and now I'm having a bit of health anxiety lol. Hopefully I can get this figured out!Do any of you pay attention to HRV?",0

456,"Hi all,

I have recently bought Watch Series 8 and found AssistiveTouch pretty cool, but I struggle with a few issues.

My current setup is:

* AssistiveTouch: On
* Hand Gestures:
   * Pinch: Forwards
   * Double Pinch: Backwards
   * Clench: Tap
   * Double Clench: Press Crown
* Confirm with AssistiveTouch: On

And now the issues:

* when ""Activation Gesture"" is set to ""None"" (== AssistiveTouch is always on automatically) - I can't confirm with AssistiveTouch when e.g. unblocking ""Security &amp; Privacy"" settings on my Mac, because the suggested ""Double Pinch"" gesture activates the ""Backwards"" action (as specified above) instead of confirming
* when ""Activation Gesture"" is set to ""Double Pinch"" - it does both: confirms the operation AND activates AssistiveTouch
* when ""Activation Gesture"" is set to ""Double Clench"" - it seems to work okay: I can confirm the operation with ""Double Pinch"" and activate AssistiveTouch with ""Double Clench"", but...
* ...**I can't make ""Confirm with AssistiveTouch"" work in Wallet at all** \- I tried all the 4 gestures with all the 3 options above, but nothing happens - the prompt doesn't change and the card is not confirmed...

I also have one more annoying issue due to which I had to disable Motion Pointer:

* I had ""Dwell Control"" turned on together with ""Shake to Start"" option
* It was fine for any gesture-only interactions with Watch - I could shake to turn on Motion Pointer, I could shake again to turn it off...
* ...but when I do any ""manual"" interaction, i.e. touch or swipe the screen, click or rotate Digital Crown etc. - **the Motion Pointer ALWAYS appears after that, even if I don't activate it with a shake**. It makes Motion Pointer simply unusable, because you can't make it solely optional as you could expect when turning on ""Shake to Start"".

Do you guys have a solution for any of the above issues?

Regards!Multiple issues with AssistiveTouch (i.a. Activation Gesture, Confirm with AssistiveTouch, Motion Pointer)",0

462,"Hi, I am looking for a way to simplify things.

To prevent my family waking up with me at 5:50 AM, I sleep with the watch on in a silent mode, so the alarm vibrates on my wrist. Super nice way to be woken up actually.

To prevent potential harmful effect of wifi and BT on my body (debatable), I use flight mode with a hard wifi and BT disable in the settings (otherwise it only disconnects, but stays on). This will disconnect watch and iphone, so the iphone thinks there is no watch anymore and the alarm goes off in the morning on both devices.

btw Wifi is manually disabled in the settings on my watch all the time to spare the battery - it is connected to the phone so why to have it on anyway? Right?

So the sequence in the bed:

* Flight mode on the watch
* Sleep mode on the watch
* Manual disable bluetooth on the watch
* Flight mode on the iphone
* Sleep settings - disable alarm manually (several steps and clicks)

I have a few really simple questions here but I just don't understand how the watch works.  I am looking to buy one as a gift for my wee girl for her birthday next month.

She currently has an iPhone 13 but her contract is with a UK company (ID Mobile) who doesn't currently offer esim.  Her contract is up in November.

We really want to get her a cellular watch but until November we won't be able to get an esim.

Here are my questions.

1.  Will the cellular watch just work the same as a non cellular one until it's set up with an esim?

2.  Come November she will get a new phone with an esim for the watch.  I take it she will be able to make the watch work with her new phone okay?

The replacement watch had the original WatchOS, so it took multiple updates to get it to pair to my phone (read as a long time!).

We're looking for setup directions that would restrict the Apple Watch to pretty much only fall notification, location sharing, time and date and eventually apps/features we carefully select with our family member. There have been accidental changes to iPhone Settings, e.g., turning on airplane mode, so we'd like to limit that possibility on the watch. 

We hope by reducing the margin of error at the start will help our family have a smooth start with the watch. If they want more functions later on, we are game to add them, we just don't want to overwhelm at the start.

700,"Hi Everyone!
2 nights ago I went swimming with my 1 year old Apple Watch SE for the first time. I turned on water lock and had no issues with it while swimming. After I got out, I immediately dried it with a microfibre cloth and set it on its port to charge overnight. The next morning I woke up and saw that my watch did not charge overnight as it has the red lightning bolt display. I thought maybe I didn‚Äôt attach it fully to the charger because I have done that before ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I switched it to a different charger and left it for 2 hours. When I went back to go grab it, the watch screen was fully black and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I tried resetting the watch which didn‚Äôt work and went on with apple support. The support person was not very helpful and just told me to book in with an authorized Apple technician to look at it. Flash forward to today, I want to go to my appointment and without even looking at my watch he said it would cost $400 to fix and it‚Äôs just better for me to buy a new one then get it repaired as it would cost the same. Has anyone else experienced this? I am so frustrated as apple advertises that their watches are made to swim in and I made sure I had the water lock on and did not go anywhere with hot water or jets. Has anyone tried escalating this with customer service and had any luck? I really don‚Äôt want to buy a new watch :(Apple Watch SE and water",0

781,"Apple announced international roaming would be coming to the Apple Watch in September 2022 ([https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/09/apple-reveals-apple-watch-series-8-and-the-new-apple-watch-se/](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/09/apple-reveals-apple-watch-series-8-and-the-new-apple-watch-se/)) and that it was working with 30+ carriers on making it a seamless feature.

It turns out it's not that straightforward with carrier websites providing very little information, unclear limitations on which countries the service works and lack of knowledge from the staff.  
This past 2 days, I've been trying to help a friend from the US whose kid wasn't able to call her from her Apple Watch while in Europe, and I found that carriers are approaching this feature in different ways.  
I'll share what I learned from AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the US, but also found some interesting discussions on carriers from Europe and Asia. Feel free to share your experience and learnings in this thread.  


**(USA - AT&amp;T) - Roaming on wearables only works natively in Canada and Mexico (Feb 2023)**

[*https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1182926/*](https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1182926/)

*The Unlimited Your Way plans now include international long-distance calling to Canada and Mexico from wearable devices that support cellular service at no additional charge. For Series 5 and higher Apple¬Æ wearables (WatchOS 9.1 or higher required ), the rate plans now also include at no additional charge:*

* *Using data and sending iMessages while in Mexico and Canada.*
* *Talk in and between Mexico and Canada and from Mexico and Canada to the United States.*
   * *Connect your wearable to a VoLTE cellular network in Mexico and Canada directly, without needing your smartphone nearby*

***FYI:*** *For travel with an Apple wearable outside of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, continue to use your smartphone cellular connection or Wi-Fi.*

There is a service called **NumberSync** that allows you to manage multiple lines, including wearables and cars, but is limited to domestic (US bound) use.

[*https://www.att.com/support/smallbusiness/article/smb-wireless/KM1225754/*](https://www.att.com/support/smallbusiness/article/smb-wireless/KM1225754/)  
*Apple Watch (GPS + Cellular) does not support domestic or international cellular roaming.*

My friend spend a couple of hours with AT&amp;T representatives on the phone, at first they said roaming would work just fine in Europe, but then tried to put the blame on the Watch saying that wearables technology was ""iffy"". Not much of a help.  


**(USA - T-Mobile) - Roaming on wearables available through a DIGITS account (Feb 2023)**

I'm a T-Mobile customer and have used their roaming worldwide for the past 9 years on my phone. No detailed information available on their websites regarding wearables, but I reached out to a representative.

It seems global roaming is available through their DIGITS service, which enables cellular (talking) capabilities over data, with their ""Data with paired DIGITS"" plan:

 [*https://www.t-mobile.com/apps/t-mobile-digits*](https://www.t-mobile.com/apps/t-mobile-digits)

Here's what the representative wrote:

*As we discussed, we have Data with paired DIGITS plans where in All international roaming calls and text are billed at the standard international rates for Simple Global and International data roaming is unlimited at 128kbps (Simple Global features)*

*Also, Adding a watch line will cost you $10 with autopay per month*

*You may rely on this helpful link to add a new watch line for your Apple device*

[*Can I make or receive calls with my cellular watch when I am roaming overseas?*](https://www.singtel.com/personal/support/mobile-postpaid/applewatch#r-250)

*Sorry, we are afraid not. International roaming is not enabled for NumberShare service. However, you can still use your cellular watch in Bluetooth mode.*

*SoftBank Corp. is thrilled to offer, on its ‚ÄúSoftBank‚Äù mobile service brand, International Roaming for the new Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation), with groundbreaking technology and performance, and Apple Watch Ultra with a revolutionary new design and breakthrough capabilities.*

*Starting November 10, 2022, SoftBank Corp. is offering international roaming for Apple Watch. With international roaming for Apple Watch, users can stay connected to a cellular network while traveling abroad simply by extending their iPhone roaming plan to Apple Watch.*

&amp;#x200B;

It seems things are not that clear in Europe either, I found some threads that mentioned UK Vodafone not being clear on the services provided.

Hope this helps and gives people a starting point on their research.

785,"I bought the SE2 for over a month now. I had no problems with it during the 1st month of use. It was super useful when I travelled abroad and had to use navigation apps for transport.

I was coming from a fitbit which I occasionally still use. The main reason I bought the SE2 was for more data when running, receiving notifications/reminders and being able to leave my phone when doing short errands. I never used AOD on my fitbit inspire 3.

Comparing with the series 8, I didn't want to spend an additional $200 to get it (that's the additional cost in my country). However, I didn't even consider or know that I would not be getting an Always-On Display in my SE2. I was browsing through the internet and it convinced me that having AOD is essential!

I bought SE2 with apple care+ (it's my first time buying a watch and I thought it's good investment to have an insurance since a watch is something that's always exposed instead of keeping in the pockets like an iPhone) which would be the same price as the Series 7 (but without apple care+). But the only colors available in stores near me are red and green which I really don't like. I don't imagine myself wearing a red watch and strap while wearing a blue suit.

Did I make a mistake for opting with the SE2 instead of spending an additional $200 to get the Series 8 with AOD? I don't need the keyboard, extra sensors, or fast charging. Just AOD. Would it be worth the extra $200?

Also, should I have just got the series 7 without apple care+ and just ""endured"" looking at the watch or should've just put it in a case??Is Buying an Apple Watch SE 2022 a mistake?",0
786,"At the risk of being banned from the subreddit, I have to ask. Why should I get the Apple Watch specifically? It seems like there's only people who like Android watches and Apple watches. I want to know, which one do I needt?

What I need is something to let me know who's calling, who's sending a message, how's my heart, what my step count is and that's that. Maybe I also like Apple's thing of detecting car accidents and falling and notifying 911 and all that. 

Other than that... I'm certainly not going to type on it with my fingers that are already too big for my iPhone keyboard.

798,"Hey all. 
Every time I hit the gym, my Apple Watch shows that I'm burning over 1000 calories per session of resistance training. And when I do dumbbell walking lunges, my watch always registers a peak heartbeat of over 200! Like for instance yesterday, when I did this exercise, it measured 210 beats at max. This just seem insane to me even though I'm pushing myself to the limits. Is it really possible to burn that many calories in 1 hour of weightlifting or is my watch just trolling me? And what about the heart rate?

Key points:

- I'm a 24 year old male

-  I usually do resistance training for 60-80 mins, it depends on what day it is. For example on Legday, I do 5x5 Squat with 4-5 minute breaks between each set.

- I don't use nicotine products

809,"So my friends and I want to do completions every week because we go to the same gym and do the same program every day. But there‚Äôs a really annoying quirk to the fitness competitions. 

Anytime you invite someone to one, it starts the next day. So if you invite on Saturday, it starts on Sunday goes until midnight the next Saturday. 

But you can‚Äôt invite to another one until that one ends that next Saturday at midnight. So then you have to invite to the next one at 12:01 on Sunday, but because of this it won‚Äôt start until Monday and then it will go until the next Sunday. Then you won‚Äôt be able to invite until the next Monday and it will start on Tuesday. So on and so forth. 

So every week, they continually will be pushed a day. It‚Äôs kind of annoying because I like when they are evenly for one whole 5 day week of workouts and would love to always have them Sunday to Saturday. But because you can‚Äôt invite to a new completion until one ends, it‚Äôs not possible.

Background: I often work as a SAG actor on ""period"" shows such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. So I'll go to work in the morning wearing my normal clothes including a fully-charged Apple Watch, change into my assigned 1950s (or 1970s or...) outfit and **remove the Apple Watch since it's not period-appropriate**. I leave my Watch with the Wardrobe department along with the rest of my regular clothes - sitting in a jacket pocket in a garment bag. At the end of the workday I return to Wardrobe and change back into my regular clothes, put my Apple Watch back on..and discover the battery has gone dead or is nearly so - I don't have the use of the watch for my return commute back home.

My *guess* is the watch goes crazy with the active sensors and that's what eats up the battery. I think it wakes up, tries to record heartrate or body temperature or wrist presence or some such using those little red lights on the back but when it can't get a reading (because it's not on a wrist) it just tries again and again and again (possibly upping the power level in case that might help) until the battery dies. 

Or maybe it's network stuff! In that case the issue is that it tries to connect via Bluetooth to my usually-present iPhone or tries to connect via wifi (it's a wifi-only watch) to some usually-present network but can't find the connections it expects so bumps up the power and checking frequency trying to resolve matters there on the assumption that I might have important text messages coming in that mustn't be missed...until the battery dies.

Anyway, my EXPECTED behavior is that a watch I'm not wearing should pretty quickly NOTICE it's not moving at all and isn't on a wrist and go to sleep and use LESS battery than if I kept wearing it, but the ACTUAL behavior is that it instead does SOMETHING that uses up all the battery. I could stop to manually power off the watch every time I leave it behind and power it back on later but that's kind of a pain.

[https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/](https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/)

I've been testing this a lot lately and ultimately trying to determine if the Workoutdoors app causes additional battery drain when running it in map only mode in the background. 

 I haven't got to that part of my testing yet, but with the Apple Workout app alone the best I'm seeing is a 1% drop every 10 minutes, so 6% per hour.  I always use a Wahoo BTLE chest strap for my HR measurements too, but this has made no difference in my testing compared to the wrist sensor in the watch. When I have low power mode on, and regardless if I use the chest strap, or if I have the 'fewer gps/hr setting enabled', I still get the same 1% drop every 10 minutes.

6% per hour is almost the 17 hours of usage that Apple claims. However, if I have my phone with me (so LTE data isn't being used by the watch), and I have low power and 'fewer gps readings enabled', I should be seeing better than 1 hours, right?

Part of my concern is that sometimes she feels 'funny' and isn't sure if that's aFib or not so she does nothing and waits it out. 

Last night she woke up feeling 'funny' and took an ECG with her watch, and was notified that she was in aFib. With that confirmation she got up and drove herself to the hospital (Grr. We are discussing that.) Hospital confirmed aFib and began treating her and were able to get it under control. They sent her home a few hours later (although wouldn't let her drive so she took a taxi and she was salty about that). She finally called me when she got home. (Grr again). 

But wanted to share an Apple Watch win! Without the watch confirmation I doubt she would have taken herself to the hospital.

1075,"I'm recently back from eight days of sailing in the USVI, including a lot of snorkeling. I've been using my Ultra and the Workout app to track pool swims since I got it, but this was my first chance to get in the ocean.

First, I made Oceanic+ a complication on my watch face. I didn't want to give over the shortcut button to it, because I also wanted to record open water swim workouts while I snorkeled and I have Workout as my shortcut. Naturally, I would occasionally look at my watch and see that it thought I was snorkeling when I was actually driving the boat, or making breakfast, or whatever, because I tend to accidentally hit the complications. Can't be helped.

When it was time to snorkel, I got my gear on and jumped in the water, then told workout to record an open water swim and told Oceanic+ to record snorkeling. Oceanic+ turned on the water lock automatically, so I could not accidentally interfere with it as I swam.

My various snorkel explorations ranged from 15 minutes to more than an hour. Oceanic+ recorded date and time, location, minimum water temperature, how many times I made surface dives, and my maximum depth (a pathetic 10 feet). I can add water condition ratings and notes to each session.

The display was easy to read, and I really liked being able to know at a glance how long I'd been out. I might try using Oceanic+ on my next pool swim to see if the pool's thermometor is accurate :-)

Also, I noted that despite running both Oceanic+ and Workout at the same time, battery life was not significantly impacted. 

I look forward to using it for scuba on a future trip.Snorkeling with Oceanic+ and Ultra",0

Hi everyone, happy to say we are starting to allow the first beta testers into the closed version 2 of Motion.

As a fellow apple fitness plus user, I can understand where it thrives and where there is more to desire.

What does Motion do?

**Data-based personalised goals-** Each user will receive a personalised weekly goal in the form of one simple score. The choice to go weekly is to allow for rest days which challenging ring targets do not. Upon sign-up, Motion analyses your recent activity data to find what you complete in an average week. From this, our algorithm calculates a weekly goal which will cause you to improve against your average levels of activity.

**Compatibility-** I know many of you will have friends with Fitbits, Garmins etc so we made Motion compatible with any smartwatch and available on IOS or Android.

**Activa tars-** Earning the badges etc is a fun way to stay engaged, but to improve on this further we have added your very own Activity Avatar (Activatar). These have the ability to be levelled up through you hitting your goal and will show emotion during the week depending on whether you are on track.

You might be thinking what's the catch? How is it free?

To be transparent, although V1 was successful we are still a relatively new startup and are just trying to grow our user base and provide value before thinking of monetising.

The link to the waitlist can be found here: [www.motion-app.com](https://www.motion-app.com/)

Very happy to answer any questions tooI saw another mention of how apple expects you to be active 365 days a year. Please check this post if you are interested in being closed beta tester for a free fitness app which provides you with a personalised weekly goal based on your historic averages",0

First week or so I wasn‚Äôt impressed, mainly with battery life, but got into a routine now never worry about battery.  Then was the fitness metrics missing, I missed things like body battery and HRV etc, but got onto Athlytic and once I figured out how to use it I was content.  This was something that really annoyed me about Garmin, they have a habit of only putting certain features on certain watches, the Watch may be capable but Garmin doesn‚Äôt want to detract from higher end watches, for instance on 245 no HRV status even though it‚Äôs capable, no that‚Äôs for the Fenix 6.

Then onto accuracy, my main interest is running, always needed a chest strap with Garmin, I discovered apple is accurate enough without a strap, GPS is also much better on Apple than any of the Garmins I had.

I bought an AW8 SS last year along with a green Alpine Loop for general use and a Nike sports band for when I do exercise. I am really pleased with the comfort of the Alpine Loop, but it is starting to stain quite considerably and I was wondering about cleaning options.

1500,"Hi, Apple Watch community,   
My name is Fred Sullivan and I am one of the founders of Motion.  
From being a long-term Reddit user, I too do not enjoy seeing ads everywhere. However, we have been working extremely hard on the new version of Motion and I want it to help as many people as possible increase their likelihood of reaching their fitness goals.  


Right, now onto the exciting stuff.   


Motion is an activity-tracking app which main purpose is to increase your activity levels as a whole. The app is available on IOS or Android along with being compatible with any smartwatch  


The app is still 100% free with zero advertisements or 3rd party tracking. If you are wondering how we make money, at this point we don‚Äôt. We are still an early-stage startup looking to build an audience that can provide valuable feedback.  


**So what is Motion and what can it do for you and your friends/family?**  


**Data-based goals.**  
We analyse your past activity data including steps. workouts and calories burned to find your ‚Äúaverage week‚Äù Based on this, we then set you a weekly goal to improve against your historic average activity levels.  
Our algorithm simplifies the data into one clear number which will increase/decrease each week depending on whether you hit your goal or not.   
Weekly goals compared to ring closing gives you more of an opportunity to have a rest day or just a day off when life gets in the way.  
**Sharing.**  
Due to compatibility with **any** smartwatch, this means you can share with **any** friend or family member.  
This can be done by simply adding friends or by creating teams. Each other‚Äôs workouts will be displayed in the feed allowing for encouragement and accountability.  
Due to the personalised goal being based on your data, it means then instead of comparing times and distance you can simply encourage people to achieve their own goals.  


**Activatars.**  
We have created your own Activity Avatar (Activatar) to provide a layer of fun when hitting your activity goals.  
These Activatars will show emotion throughout the week (also available as a widget on the home screen)¬† depending on whether you are on track to hit your goal.  
In addition to this, upon hitting your goal you will start to unlock ‚Äòshakes‚Äô which can be used to level up and evolve your Activatar. These will then be shareable with your friends too.  


I am aware that when someone offers something for free it can be seen as too good to be true.  
In this case, the app is still genuinely free.

Of course, there will be a point in the future when we may add a freemium model, but being transparent we still have no plan to do this anytime soon.

From version 1 we had a great user base of apple watch users who loved the app. We are just trying to build on this with V2 and make an app people get a lot of benefit and enjoyment from.  


**Sounds like it would be great for you.**  


We will be releasing V2 from **next week**  
All you have to do is sign up through this link to receive your access code:  
[www.motion-app.com/v2](http://www.motion-app.com/v2)

I got an S6 (GPS) a year ago but honestly haven‚Äôt used it as much as I probably should‚Äîthe main issue is that the battery only lasts ~20 hours on my wrist so I have to charge it daily and forget about putting it back on (plus I keep taking it off to cook or something and then forget about it). Anyway, that‚Äôs my Apple Watch background. 

About 3 months ago, I had a mild but fairly terrifying medical scare due to some medication issues where I had a dangerously high heart rate and some afib. I knew something was wrong but it wasn‚Äôt until I checked my heart rate with the watch that I realised what exactly was wrong. So, yay Apple Watch for that!

Okay, now on to the actual meaningful content. I am wondering if and how people have utilised the Apple Watch with regards to monitoring/counteracting extreme anxiety and stress. I am medically diagnosed with anxiety and I‚Äôm so constantly feeling stressed that it‚Äôs just the status quo for me. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt great for my mental or physical health and I always have headaches and extreme tension throughout my muscles. I guess what I‚Äôm wondering is if people have found the Apple Watch useful for alerting themselves about the physiological symptoms of stress and anxiety in order to try to be proactive about combatting it (whether meditation or yoga or whatever). My anxiety includes panic attacks, which aren‚Äôt any fun, but I‚Äôm usually to fixated on what‚Äôs going on externally that it never quite registers how extreme my body‚Äôs response is. 

I feel like there‚Äôs a way to make the watch a lot more useful to be more tuned in with the signs of extreme stress and anxiety, but I don‚Äôt know what that is‚Ä¶ Of course I‚Äôm also working with a psychiatrist and a therapist, but I‚Äôm trying to be more proactive about my health and investing in ways to help myself out.

Sorry for the rambly post!

TL;DR: is there a way to monitor physiological symptoms to alert the wearer that they‚Äôre experiencing high stress/anxiety or panic attacs? &amp; would it be worth upgrading to a newer watch to take advantage of such?

If it‚Äôs meant to be in water surely they would cover it in the warranty? This seems like false advertising to me.

When you're working out, the default always goes to the workout app. This is frustrating when you're trying to focus on a workout and slightly derails the workout itself.

There's two stages to this:

A) The Apple Watch functions as normal for awhile. That's okay with me.

B) When you get to actually working out and an Apple Watch senses this, the Apple Watch starts defaulting on screen to the workout app. 

Part B is where workouts get distracted.

Example: If I am on 5k run, every time I go to switch songs to a new track that's motivational, I've got to go through a series of steps to get to the music app. The workout app always comes up as the default when I touch the Apple Watch.

First of all, I expect this will probably get downvoted, because of how trivial my question is. While I am aware that AWU was explicitly also designed to be water resistant up to 100m - I have never, ever, went into water with an electronic gadget. However, I going to Spa tomorrow, and I am deciding to purchase Oceanic Band and give it my 'first'.   


I came here to Reddit to ask those, who will be willing to share their experience with having AWU inside Swimming Pools.  Here are my newbie questions:

1. Do I need to setup some Mode before I go into water?
2. Is it OK to be in water that are more warmer (28-32 degrees)? 
3. Does the Chloride that is used in our swimming pools, damage the AWU?
4. How long can I be in water with my AWU? In Spas I don't usually just swim, but I am in water for a prolonged time, relaxing. 
5. When I get out, I have to do some 'water clear' process. Does it trigger automatically on AWU? Is this reliable enough to just run it, and trust it is OK?
6. Finally, what is your experience with other AWs throughout the years. If you use them few times a year in Swimming Pools / Sea .. will the watch degrade faster (battery, corrosion, some mechanical issues,..)?  


I do apologies for the trivial questions, as I know most will point me to the fact it is built water resistant, but since I am literally 'afraid' of using electronics in water (damage the device or hurt potentially myself) - I would like to beat this fear for the first time, with your help.Using AWU in swimming pools",0

I traditionally only select a single playlist of 1000 songs to be put on  the Watch (SE1), but since 9.0 or 9.1 (don't know for sure)  it keeps on downloading songs (a lot more than those 1000) until it  eventually tells me the Watch is full. During the transfer of all those  songs the battery drain (both on Watch and iPhone) is enormous. Anybody  else experiences this too?

When I deselect the playlist to be put on the Watch (in the iPhone Watch app), the number of songs on the Watch stays exactly the same. This is also very strange, because with no music selected it should be 0, right, and all music should be erased? Only when I reselect the playlist it briefly goes back to 0, but then it starts downloading all the songs again (and a lot more).

Something else that seems off to me is when I go into 'Music' in the  'Settings' on the Apple Watch itself (not on iPhone), I can't switch of  the first option ('add playlist songs' or something like that). When I  switch it off and go back, it's switched on again. Is anybody able to  switch off the first option? Maybe this causes the problem? Maybe this means it downloads all the available playlists from my iPhone on the Watch, and not only the one I selected?

I'm on 9.3 now and nothing changed. I want to hear if other people experience the exact same problem? Because the last few months a lot of people seem to have problems with Apple Watch and music, but the problems differ a lot.

I have an Apple Watch Ultra and a Series 7. Recently (last 2 months or so) I have gotten into running pretty regularly. 

When I first got my Ultra it was activated using my series 7 back up.

Flash forward to now. I have used my series 7 on a few runs and it is under reporting known distances up to about 1/4 mile sometimes more.

1643,"Hello. 

So I ordered an Apple Watch at the end of January, and it was meant to arrive a few days later. It got delayed and UPS couldn‚Äôt deliver it.

 I talked with Apple, and they asked me, (to paraphrase) in the event that the watch is lost, if I would prefer a replacement or a refund. 

I answered a replacement of my exact model, so they had a replacement shipped to me later that day, so I assume Apple assumed it was lost.

In the meantime, somebody brought up to me going to the Apple Store, buying the watch there, and returning the replacement when it got here. 

I said sure, so that‚Äôs what the plan was. I have had my Apple Watch for a few days, and my replacement just got here. 

The problem is, UPS was able to deliver my original watch, which Apple thinks is lost (I assume), so now I have my original order, the replacement, and the one I bought at the store, but only got charged for two.

I plan on returning the replacement at my local store for a refund, but what do I do about the third watch that Apple thinks is lost? Can I get in trouble for trying to sell it for more money?Legality question",0

1647,"Hello,

I recently decided to give a go with SleepWatch and it looks promising to me (compared to AutoSleep, which produced a bit too much data to me that I couldn't digest). One thing I like at AutoSleep is that I can override their 'algorithms' for Sleep detection and force them to use Apple's. 

However, I couldn't find anywhere how SleepWatch works? I think by default they are doing their own thing, since I compared the Sleep Stages and they differentiate with what Apple Watch reported to 'Health App'. They also use different wordings such as 'Restful', which I assume is for 'Deep' sleep.

1654,"Hey all,

I‚Äôm a current owner of a Garmin Fenix 6X (nearly two years). I‚Äôm not an ultra marathon runner or trek enthusiast etc etc - I wanted a large watch that tracked everything I did. And, at the time, the Fenix 6X fit the bill.

Two years later, I‚Äôm hovering over purchasing an Apple Watch Ultra (with the yellow ocean band) and selling the Fenix.

I love the size and I also use a MacBook Pro, iPhone and AirPods Pro.

My girlfriend and brother both have Apple Watches (Series 3 and 6) and I‚Äôve watched how the watch seamlessly exists in their life, connecting from Mac to iPad, answering calls to closing rings etc.

I‚Äôm curious to hear if anyone else made the switch from a similar Garmin device and what their thoughts were? Someone who is into fitness but not an enthusiast I suppose.

Garmin Connect is so feature rich but then at the same time, as I‚Äôm not a professional athlete a lot of the metrics (Training Status, Body Battery etc) are probably wasted on me - sure they‚Äôre cool to look at but as my girlfriend pointed out, closing her rings is so much fun üòÇ.

I generally get about 3-4 weeks of battery life which is awesome and great to shout from the rooftops. However, as I‚Äôm not an ultra marathoner and won‚Äôt be stranded in the middle of nowhere for days on end, I feel as though the added battery is more of a convenience tbh.

I mainly use my Garmin for treadmill running and strength training everyday. For work, it‚Äôs vital for call notifications. 

I‚Äôm between a rock and a hard place I suppose - if I didn‚Äôt already own a Fenix, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever consider getting a Fenix now that the Ultra exists. But then, on the other hand, I‚Äôve watched a lot of videos where people swear by their Garmins.

I have to manually turn this off every morning on my watch. It's getting a little annoying. Besides that, my watch works like a charm!

Now over time, I've found that it's straight up not working at all. Every time I want to use it to tap in/out, the machine will blink red (though the watch does say ""done"", it doesn't register on the actual oyster reader)

As a workaround, I've had to resort to double clicking the side button and scrolling down to the card I use for travel - to make things even worse, most of the time the watch will just use my default payment card (not the express card I have selected), even when I have a different card selected and ready to pay.

Does anybody else have tried something like this, I have had the ultra with a data plan just for a couple of days and so far:

Pros: 
- I love the refreshing feeling of not taking my phone
- The main things I want work great (music, calls, messages, payments ‚Ä¶)
- Messages and dictation works amazingly well, way better than in other Apple Watches
- Battery is much better


Cons:
- it seems not possible to do anything with the watch while in a FaceTime call, I tried to pay while in a call and Apple Pay was not triggered!
- some basic support to preview pdfs or something would be great (I.e checking an email)
- charging seems very slow, not sure if where I plugged it but seems to take ages, anyone has any references?
- it‚Äôs design is questionable, some angles looks great, others it simply looks bulky
- Lack of app support, like Google‚Äôs authenticator, Revolut and others require the phone to login ‚Ä¶

1741,"Hey guys,

I own AWU with a Trail Loop which I enjoy. However, when I workout, I try to tighten it a bit more. And when I go to sleep I try to wear ti more lose than during the day. So basically, I have to adjust it  3x a day and what I struggle with is, that with such band, there are no holes which you could memorize. When I had Garmin Epix2, it was really cool to adjust the band, just by counting the holes (once I figured out tightness for each activity).  


I am really stressed whether it is too tight for daily use, or too tight for sleep. It does not necessary feel tight at the moment I adjust, but having it throughout the night.. sometimes I see more intense 'marks' after removing the watch, and sometimes it is alright. 

  
I wish I had a technique with this band to memorize how to put it, but can't find a way. 

I consider purchasing Spigen's Rugged Band, which seems to be most similar  to Epix2 (which I loved), but that one might have issues, because it is not originally for AWU.

1755,"There‚Äôs no doubting that the Apple Watch has plenty of features and methods of collecting data. Heart rates, ECG, blood oxygen levels, running forms, hearing data, temperature measurements, and much more. This data that being collected is unlike the data being collected is far more than what smartphones can collect as it benefits from sitting on the users wrist in direct contact with their skin. 

The problem is that Apple collects all of this data, and instead of utilising the data in a meaningful way, just throws it all into the health application where the user can attempt to analyse the data on their own, or download plenty of third party applications that will make use of your data, typically accompanied by a mandatory subscription. The only real interaction that apple communicates with users regarding their data is the occasional notification regarding trends, and some health alerts such as loud environmental noise or a high heart rate. 

If you look at the competition, you can see how other companies like Garmim and Samsung collects less data but manages to implement features that manage to communicate important information directly with the user. This, because it‚Äôs done directly by them and has to go through vigorous tests, tends to be more accurate than third party apps as well as being completely free. You will see how if you wanted similar functionality on the Apple Watch, you‚Äôd have to spend a fortune. 

Functionality that the Apple Watch is missing but competitions have is as follow:

# Stress level monitoring
On the Samsung watch, you can see the levels of stress throughout your day and can be notified to take a moment if your stress levels are high. This uses HRV levels to do this.

The closest thing you can get to this on Apple Watch is an app called Stress Detector, which costs ¬£49.99 per year. 

# Readiness Score/Fitness recovery times
Garmin uses your data (HRV along with other info) to estimate how ready you are so you can avoid over working out or being too idle. A low score indicates a score of you having to relax, and a high score means you are ready for anything. 

The closest apps you can get to this is training today, which is ¬£15 per year, or Gentle Streak, which is ¬£50 per year. 

# Sleep Results
Garmin gives personalised recommendations based on your sleeping habits. If you don‚Äôt sleep enough, it will notify you encouraging you to sleep more. If it notices anything abnormal during your sleep, it will also notify you. It can tell you if your body didn‚Äôt actually rest properly even if you feel fine, letting you plan ahead and reduce burning out your body. 

Not aware of any apps that work like this. Auto sleep gives some decent info but no where as near as the level that Garmin does. All apple does is tell you that you reached your goal, and doesn‚Äôt even tell you if you didn‚Äôt.

# Snore Detection
The Samsung watch can detect you snoring. Very simple stuff, but can snoring can be a good indication of sleep apnea.

Best app for this is Sleep Cycle, which costs ¬£35 per year. 

# Sleep Apnea Detection
The Samsung watch can detect Sleep Apnea by monitoring your blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and respiratory rate. You could go to the health app on iPhone and analyses the data yourself, but you can‚Äôt see it all on one screen so you‚Äôd have to jump back and forth. For your average consumer, doing this on their own isn‚Äôt feasible. 

You can get NapBot for detecting sleep apnea for ¬£10 per year. 

# Step Tracking
This is a little nick-Pick but let‚Äôs say your day to day life doesn‚Äôt revolve comfortably around closing your rings every day and you prefer to walk. Some people prefer tracking your steps, but unfortunately Apple has no complications to track your number of steps, and the only way to see them is to open the fitness app and scroll down until you see your steps. No notifications or indication of your progress. Garmim and Samsung let you see this data if you want, but Apple insists on using their rings. 

If you want to track your steps, then StepsApp Pedometer is your best shot, costing ¬£20 per year

#### Summary 
As you can see, doing all of this would cost a lot of money and require many individual apps from companies that could delete them at any moment. The data is there, but apple is simply deciding to dump it all into the health app rather than focusing on the benefits that the data could be used for. Apple is already working on the next hardware innovation, but is not focusing on the software side of things.The data that Apple manages to collect through their innovative feature set is impressive, but isn‚Äôt being utilised as much as it could be",0

1763,"Hi everyone, this may be a dumb question but I'm new to Apple Watch and haven't been able to find this question in the sub yet. 

The Fitness app will use calories burned as the overall measure of your workout in terms of intensity or performance. And as I understand it, the number of calories burned is largely determined based on your heart rate. 

This makes me wonder, as I get more in shape I should have to work progressively harder to elevate my heart rate and keep it elevated, right? So if for example when I first started working out with Apple Watch I rode a stationary bike at a set resistance level for 30mins and burned 300 calories. If I do that same workout with the same resistance every day for 2 months, it's going to get easier for me, and my heartrate won't be as high while doing it. So after 2 months of this same workout, is it likely that my Apple Watch will actually show me burning fewer calories with the same workout? And is it just the reality that you burn fewer calories if you don't increase the intensity of a workout as you get into better shape, or is it a limitation of the calorie tracking on Apple Watch? 

Thanks in advance!Calories Burned as Measure of Workout Intensity/Performance",0

However ever since I purchased the watch (about a month ago), i've noticed that it records extremely inaccurate readings. As in, it will occasionally record very low readings (50s, 60s and 70s, which I know is not low for others but is low for me as my resting HR rate is always 100-110) out of nowhere. I know that these are not accurate because I downloaded an app that can continuously monitor my HR, and I have never gotten a reading below 90. It is very rarely below 100. I know for a fact that a reading that low would be impossible for me, so I have no idea where they're coming from.

This is very annoying as the inaccurate readings completely mess up my chart and remove any possibility of me being able to track my heart rate accurately. I would simply keep the third party app running all the time, as it's pretty much 100% accurate, but it drains a lot of battery and means I can't use my watch for fitness reasons at the same time.

I have tried adjusting the tightness and everything but as my recordings are completely accurate on the third party app it seems to be an issue with apple's technology itself.

why is this happening? is there anything I can do to fix it?

1851,"i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôm missing something, but i expected the music experience to be more unified between watch and iphone.

instead, there are two separate sections in music on the watch, one to play music directly on the watch, and another that acts as an iphone remote. 

the two separate menus are almost exactly the same, except the iphone one doesn‚Äôt have search, which is quite inconvenient.

but what‚Äôs even more inconvenient is that if you start playing something on the watch, you can‚Äôt switch the output to the phone later. you have to stop the music, go into the separate iphone menu, and start the music again on the iphone separately. 

this also means that if you switch from watch to phone, you have to search the song you were listening to on the watch and start it again on the phone. there‚Äôs no continuity.

when i‚Äôm in the car, i want to start music from the watch, using the search function. this means i connect the watch directly to the cars stereo via bluetooth. problem is, if i start map directions, the voice now comes from the iphone‚Äôs speaker. 

the solution would be to connect the iphone to the car‚Äôs stereo instead of the watch, and only use the watch as a remote, but as said, the iphone remote section doesn‚Äôt have a search function.

again i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm missing something. but to me it should simply be: one music menu. you start the music, and then the little airplay icon should have the ability to change the destination to the iphone too, among the other devices. that‚Äôs it. i don‚Äôt see the reason for two separate menus.why isn‚Äôt music more unified with the iphone?",0

Rebooting it didn't help, leaving the watch shut down for a whole night didn't help.

1934,"I got the Apple watch to help with my heath.  It is an expensive accessory and some might think a bit of a gimmick for quite a bit of things.   I already had more than one watch that could tell the time.  The also were solar powered and had atomic sync capabilities so they were great in they were little to no maintenance that I could keep on all the time and not need to think about.

They however were not a smart watch like the iWatch and didn‚Äôt have any health tracking capabilities.

There were several features that I was interested in.  One was the core body temperature tracking.  I had classic covid in January 2020 before they even had a name for it and didn‚Äôt have any of the tests and everything else.   I was really sick for 2-3 weeks but want hospitalized so I guess I was lucky.  But post recovery has been tough and I am sure I have the long covid problems that many talk about.  One is that I am constantly feeling like I am burning up when I do any concentrated activity.  It‚Äôs far worse in the summer time but I goes on all year round.   The Apple iWatch series 8 with the temperature sensor intrigued me if it can record if my body core temperature is actually going up or down with these attacks so I had something to take with me to the doctor.   The Apple representative said yes, it needs to be worn for 5 nights to get a core body temperature but after that it will track the change in your core temperature change.  But that seems to be a bit of a BS stretch as it only checks the temperature average over the night time while you are sleeping and so is useless for my need.  In fact it‚Äôs a useless feature to anyone unless your female I guess and are tracking ovulation.   I am not.

Another core feature I wanted was  to help me when I misplace my iPhone.   I was told that as I have a newer iPhone with the U1 chip that the watch can be used to tell you accurately where your phone is.  Nope.  It was told it can give an arrow saying the phone is for example 10 feet away in that arrow pointing direction.   Well, I can‚Äôt see it.   The find my devices is is even worse than the iPhones one in it tells me what city it‚Äôs in but I already know that.  I know what house it‚Äôs in, but what I don‚Äôt know is where.

Sort of sad really.   I do like the watch and it‚Äôs got other features that a cool.  Just wish it would have done what I bought it for.Disappointed that Apple associate misled me on some functionality",0

My iPad Pro is using the same Apple ID as another iPhone I use for work purposes. I do this as I don‚Äôt want my personal messages or calls coming through to my iPad. 

Therefore I have 2 apple ids. I understand the apple systems and continuity between devices. But I can not get my watch to link to my iPad when I use fitness plus. Support are clueless with this. Which is odd considering they are trying to push fitness plus now. They even told me you can‚Äôt use an iPad with a watch.

When looking around, the available options I have locally are:

* Used Apple Watch SE (gen 1) cellular for $200
* Used Apple Watch Series 5 cellular for $250
* New/refurbished Apple Watch Series 6 cellular for $300
* New Apple Watch SE (gen 2) cellular for $400

Is there any reason to prefer one model over the other? Other than the always on display on the non-SE models they all look more or less the same to me when I read about them. 

I kind of expect the watch to get scratches and perhaps even break eventually, even with a bumper case, so I don't want to spend too much on it. So for that reason an Apple Watch SE (get 1) in good condition looks like the most preferable option right now unless you can convince me otherwise.

For some reason Scribble is still not available for any of the Nordic languages and virtual keyboard is only available from Series 7 and upwards.

167,"Hey everyone,

I'm trying to decide where to go next in my watch journey. Started with Fitbit but after those crapping out every 1-2 years I decided to try Garmin. I have the Venu 2 and it's starting to show its age a bit, so I'm looking at mixing it up. I love having details on health stats (like sleep, O2, heart rate, calories, etc) but I get absolutely no use out of any of Garmin misc. sports oriented features. I don't care really about tracking the actual paths of my runs or whatever. So with that in mind (and also having a Galaxy phone) I thought it'd make more sense to get more functionality out of my watch that I'd actually use (like text integration and such) compared to paying premium prices for an admittedly sturdier watch filled with things I don't care about.

This brings me to my comparison research of the classic 4 versus the 5. I've always been interested in the mechanical bezel of the classic 4 because it looks nice and has a useful functionality, but I'm worried about if that feature is prone to issues like longevity or mechanical issues over time. That being said, if it is an issue, and the 5 has substantial improvements on how it tracks health stats like calories and sleep, then I could suck it up and get the 5. And honestly I don't really care about battery life that much since I can just charge it every day I take it off to shower.

So what is everyone's opinions on this? Is the 5 a meaningful upgrade over the Classic 4? Are either a good alternative to Garmin options?Is the Rotating Bezel worth it or is it a gimmicky detriment?",1

181,"Just got a GW5 Pro and thought I'd have a play with WFS so I can have everything matching. After a day of learning things I hit a wall where I couldn't find the info on complications I was after. I thought the best way would be to just take a best guess approach and just test the face and see. Here's where the problem happened.  


Attempt 1 (WIFI):  
I followed the instructions on connecting my watch to the PC WFS for testing. Enabled dev mode, turn on ADB and wifi debugging, hit the button in WFS. WFS couldn't see my watch. I tried multiple times turning all the settings off and on again and going through the steps 1 by 1 and double checking what I was reading. I tried manually adding IP address as well.  


Attempt 2 (Bluetooth):  
After giving up I went through the instructions for instead using my phone (S23 Ultra) connected to my PC via USB cable, connect to GW5 with bluetooth to the phone. Seemed easy enough until I hit the issue of turning on bluetooth debugging on my phone. I looked everywhere for it, it doesn't exist. I could see my phone in WFS but not my watch. Once again checked settings everywhere, dev options and in the Wear app too.  


Attempt 3 (APK Build):  
Third attempt was to just ""build"" the face and load it manually. It gave me 2 files APK and AAB, I put them in a shared folder and installed the APK on my phone through the network. After a couple of security warning popups it finished and it didn't do anything that I can see. I tried copying both the files onto my phone and reinstalling the APK. Still no luck.  


So, after trying 3 different ways I'm lost as to what to try next. There's no point spending more time on building my custom watch face if it's not even possible to use it.

However, for the past 2 weeks, it's been awful. For a 3.2 mile run, it's logging it as 4+ miles, showing an incorrect pace (I guess because the distance is wrong) and when I look at a map, instead of being a smooth line going around the roads, it's all over the place and all squiggly cutting across the road back and forth.

Any ideas ?Google assistant can't hear me",1
212,"OK, this may take some time, but here are the basic steps. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions. 

1. Make sure your watch is in debugging mode. If it isn't, go to SETTINGS/ABOUT WATCH/SOFTWARE INFO
    Look for SOFTWARE VERSION - when you find it, tap it 7 times to unlock developer options. 
     get back to the SETTINGS main page and select the¬†Developer options¬†at the bottom of the page. Scroll down to ADB options and enable it. Also, enable ADB over WiFi. When you do that, an IP address should pop up. That's your watches IP address. (Ex. 192.60.X.XX)  write it down. 

2. Download EASY FIRE TOOLS from the Play Store. This will allow you to sideload the TONE SELECTOR app to your watch.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.agondev.easyfiretools

3. Download the APK for TONE SELECTOR from here. Don't install it. Just download the APK to your phone. 

https://m.apkpure.com/tone-selector-ringtone-alarm/com.tone.selector/download

The apk link is down toward the bottom. It's 1.9MB.

Now open EASY FIRE TOOLS (EFT) on your phone,  make sure your watch is close, and both are connected to the same WiFi network. 

In the top left corner of EFT, click the 3 bars and then click settings. Go down to IP address,  then type in the IP address of your watch you wrote down earlier. Once you hit ok in the top right of the screen, you will see a plug looking icon. Click it, and it will attempt to connect to your watch. You will have to click ""ok"" on your watch to allow the connection. (Make sure the ADB over WiFi on your watch is turned on, like I explained earlier)   The plug turns green, I think, to show it's connected. 
     
Once you're ""connected"" to your watch, you'll see two options at the top of the EFT screen. ""Installed apps and ""custom apk""  

Click on ""custom apk"" and then search in your phone for the TONE SELECTOR apk you downloaded earlier. Click it, install it, and after a few minutes, it should install directly onto your watch.  Then all you have to do is open the TONE SELECTOR APP on your watch (it has a little TS symbol)

To use the TS app. Open it on your watch. Press and hold whatever you want to change. Ringtone, notification or alarm, and then follow the prompts to the desired music file you want. Use the Gear Wearable app to load music onto the watch like normal and use the TONE SELECTOR APP to set them as ringtones or whatever. 

NOTE:  When your watch dies or is shut off, sometimes the ringtones will go back to stock sounds. No worries, just open TS, press and hold ringtones, and then just re-select the ringtone you want. You'll get so used to it that I can do it in less than 5 seconds now. 

Hope this helps. Any questions you can DM me or message me here.Fix for Custom Ringtones on Watch 5",1
213,"Hi all,

So I've seen a few posts around here from people who can't change to custom notification and ring tone sounds anymore. I just got a gw5 and first thing I wanted to do was replace my notification sound to a star trek sound, but couldn't do it. 

I did some digging and found the following post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/10jcgbx/tool_allinone_tool_for_windows_wear_os_tools_v80/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button

It basically is a tool for windows that changes the ringtone and the notification sound for you on any wearOS device without any hassle! Literally no need to write long sentences of code. It's a user interface that helps you do it all the way. 

You need the ADB toolkit for windows
Activate ADB debugging on watch
The tool created by /u/bernarbernuli

It took me less then 5 minutes to change it. 
Please check it out and follow the steps. It works! But I do expect that after a reboot you loose the custom sound (as others have posted). I haven't restarted or rebooted yet so idk.

216,"So about a month ago my Watch 4 40mm started rebooting when charging and showing an error message. Took it into Samsung and got the motherboard replaced and a week later it started doing the same exact thing. I plan on taking it back to the Samsung store next week while the repair and watch are still under warranty but I figured it was a lost cause and got a Watch 5 Pro. 

I think my Watch 4 crapped out because of my job. I work with marine animals and sometimes it gets splashed but never dunked into a tank and always lightly rinsed and dried with fresh water and the water eject feature is used. It lasted almost a year of constant abuse so I guess it's all I can expect. Obviously these watches are not designed for saltwater use but I know several people using Galaxy and Apple watches at my job and they haven't had any issues. 

Obviously it's a massive size increase. The screen size is nice but damn is it bulky. Bulkier than my TicWatch E3 which I now I have in rotation because I'm clearly too hard on my watches. I grabbed a Samsung case for it but I can't find any water resistant cases which seems to be available for Apple Watches (sucks that Samsung gets shafted for third party accessories.) So far the battery life and performance blows my Watch 4 out of the water even though the specs are very similar. The original watch strap sucks though. It's not very intuitive and lacks the ease of a traditional strap. 

Overall it's a nice upgrade but I'm wary of it lasting more than a year. I'd like to see a Samsung watch that can handle deep saltwater use like the Apple Watch Ultra but this seems like my best bet for now. Hopefully this watch can live up to the Pro name.Upgraded to Watch 5 Pro",1

Hi everyone,

So  I was looking for a wireless charger for both my Galaxy Watch 5 and my  S21 FE. I also have the Galaxy Buds Live and the Galaxy Buds2. I came  across the Trio Wireless Charger (see link below), but it only says it's  compatible with Galaxy Watch Active, GW2 and GW3. However, it's a  product from 3 years ago I think, and also the listings of phones stops  at the Note 20 series.

So maybe  the listing with compatible devices is just outdated and the GW Active,  GW2 and GW3 are just indications for only ""Samsungs watches""? Because I  don't believe the S21 series can't charge but the Note 20 series can.

Thanks  in advance if you let me know :). I found a good deal (only 62 euros)  for this and it comes with cable and adapter included so I really hope  it'll be compatible.

232,"So I have a weird issue. I have long covid and I got the GW5 to monitor mainly my HR and sleep. A big long covid problem for a lot of people including myself is a shooting heart rate when you stand up (POTS). I've noticed that the GW5 is basically useless for seeing these sudden spikes because the HR reading will just blink for literal minutes until the heart rate stabilizes? At least that's my explanation. It never shows my values right after I stand up which is exactly what I need it to show me. Readings I got from the regular tracking went right up to around 120. 

Then I noticed the ""workout"" mode is much more responsive and does not have the blinking problem. But ever since I started turning ""other workout"" on before I stand up and move around the house it's been going as high as 157, with regular readings in the 140-150 range, which would be a \~70BPM jump from just sitting down. It usually shows some time after I do some very light activities and it's quick to go back down, but I'm wondering if this is accurate or somehow giving me false info. I don't feel my heart thumping out of my chest during these readings, I actually feel pretty normal all things considered. When I manually measure by pressing my wrist and counting for 15sec I usually get around 110-120, but I've never counted a 150+.

Basically, the time displayed on my watch is always accurate. And when my watch auto-records a workout, it's also accurate to the current time. But, when I manually record any workout, the time displayed on my watch during that workout will be 6 hours into the future. This will happen for the entire duration of the workout and as soon as I stop tracking it, the time is correct on my watch again.

It's a small detail, but it's frustrating as the Samsung Health app also shows the inaccurate times for when I did the workout, so it will say that I worked out at 1am the next day which skews my daily exercise data. It's also frustrating because when I'm manually recording a workout I can't see what the actual time is.

**Problem:**

I start an elliptical training exercise, but the heart rate shows same start rate for a good 5 or 10 mins, then shoots up to my actual rate of 155 or higher (image with 20 Feb 2023 date on). Yesterday I tested it against the sensor on my elliptical machine and it confirmed 168 bpm whilst the Samsung Watch showed 120 bpm. Then after a while it shot up to the correct reading for the rest of the exercise.

Mostly what I've been noticing is, it rises a bit after the start of the exercise, then there is no reading for 5 or 10 minutes, then it is suddenly back for rest of the exercise at correct heart rate (image with 6 Feb 2023 date on).

It seems more noticeable since the software update.

**What I've done:**

1. Wear watch an extra notch tighter during exercise.
2. Tried pausing / restarting exercise.
3. Have latest OS on watch, phone and Samsung Health app.
4. Rebooted watch.
5. Watch was also completely reset last week after I got a new phone.

Any suggestions would be welcome. But I'm wondering if anyone also has this pattern?

Upon sign-up, Motion analyses your recent activity data to find what you complete in an average week. From this, our algorithm calculates a weekly goal which will cause you to improve against your average levels of activity.

You can connect with these friends through:  
\- Simply adding friends to see their activity in the feed  
\- Creating teams to challenge or work towards a goal together

383,"So, switching form my WaerOS based Huawei Watch 2 I was expecting some kind of big tech quantum leap. I am using GW4 for some time now, and here are some of my observations :

\- Huawei Watch 2 has this cool automatic sleep detection, with the possibility that it can automatically set itself to DnD mode, switch off cell network radio etc. - all this to allow me to sleep without any disturbances. It works even for a short nap, and it's surprisingly reliable. I can't see anything similar on my Watch 4 - I think it's not possible ?

\- E-mails - on HW2 it was possible to tap ""delete"" under e-mail notification (I am using FairEmail application) and the unwanted e-mail was deleted. Check mark appears, and it's gone. On GW4 it does not delete the unwanted e-mail, but it's also showing me to ""Continue on the phone"" - but there's nothing to continue. I've tried also Outlook and native Samsung e-mail - none is working as I need. (Samsung e-mail even does not show the ""Delete"" option)

\- App drawer - who invented this terrible menu with bubble icons without description on GW4 ? I think I totally don't like the OneUI implementation over stock WearOS UI. If only they would allow to switch between them...

\- I thought it was not possible to have Google Wallet configured on the watch without PIN ? This morning my GW4 did not ask me for PIN after I put it on my wrist. I checked Google Wallet then, and it started without problem.

\- Last night I was almost asleep, but then I got 3-4 notifications from apps on the phone. Interesting, because my GW4 was in the ""Sleep mode"" and definitely showing ""DnD"" icon.

I think I'll put the GW4 in drawer for some time and see if it gets better after some more updates, because for now it's not offering me much improvements over HW2 (and HW2 has twice the battery life...)

P.S. GW4 loses about 11-12% overnight with sleep monitoring, HW2 only 4-5%. GW4 is offering ECG and Body Composition features, but these are the only features that keep me from selling it, really.Galaxy Watch 4 - no automatic sleep detection with DnD mode ?

I'm not sure what the issue is. I can watch YouTube videos on the watch disconnected from the phone so I know it's getting a signal...

When I first got the watch it would say ""emergency calls only"" and text just wouldn't go out.
I talked to t-mobile a few times and they said they fixed it on their end.

Now when I try to make a phone call I just get a busy signal.

513,"So I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm gonna get the s23 ultra in a couple months (when my contract period is up). I feel like I want more in my phone than iPhone can give me, and have decided to do the jump after lots of research. However that also means I‚Äôll have to let go of my Apple Watch, as it‚Äôs not compatible with any other brand. I really like my Apple Watch honestly, and I‚Äôm kind of nervous about that change. It‚Äôs not that I use it for anything very Apple specific, aside from using Siri, but I know galaxy watches also have voice assistant, so it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to get used to. But what I‚Äôm nervous about is if it‚Äôll feel like a downgrade. Now hear me out before you fly into an Apple hateful rage, i am not an android/Samsung hater in the slightest, and I will explain exactly why I have this fear.

So, the current watch I have is an Apple Watch SE. It was released in 2020 and was basically an entry level watch compared to their mainline watch Apple Watch 6 released on the same exact day.
One month ago I thought I‚Äôd try to get a galaxy watch to get a feel for it and be prepared for the phone switch. Because the galaxy watch 3 is the latest watch that also work on iPhone, AND it was released just a month before the Apple Watch SE that has worked perfectly for me this far, I thought it would be a good fit. I bought a used one (which my SE was too) and paired it to my iPhone. Now of course I didn‚Äôt expect every function to be available when not using a galaxy device (I did my research) but I was honestly so disappointed. 
It was incredibly slow, it struggled to do most things properly. Apps refusing to update, bixby rarely working, apps not starting‚Ä¶ 
I‚Äôm quite big into tech overall. The first thing I did was to try and update the watch. It took many tries before it finally updated. But despite updating and restarting, the problems didn‚Äôt get better.

One of my main usages of the Apple Watch is using Siri to set timers. It‚Äôs super convenient to just say ‚Äúhey siri, set a 10 minute timer‚Äù or hold down the button and say ‚Äúset a 10 minute timer‚Äù. The fact that bixby barely wanted to work at all made me unable to use this watch. I went back to my Apple Watch very quickly as I needed that function to work. I also was disappointed in the vibration as it was very weak despite being on the higher setting - I use my watch as an alarm in the morning and I don‚Äôt think that low vibration would do much.

So that‚Äôs what has me worried. If my entry level Apple Watch works so much better than the main series galaxy watch (from my experience), will the newest galaxy watch even be an upgrade? Has your galaxy watch been working without issues? Did I just happen to get a really bad watch? Maybe it was used more intensely than my SE? (Which I only had for like half a year and also bought used). Is the watch 3 prone to issues? Again I know it‚Äôs not optimal with an iPhone, but these don‚Äôt sound like issues caused by my phone brand not matching, but rather the watch having issues in itself.
Even more interested to hear from others who went the same route from Apple to Samsung.

Again I‚Äôm truly not trying to shit on Samsung as a whole, I know the phones are pretty darn amazing, and I really want to do the jump. I just need to get this cleared up. Getting the new phone and then getting a watch that doesn‚Äôt do what I need it to do but being unable to use the previous one due to the phone not matching would be catastrophic.Regarding my upcoming change from Apple to Samsung + My experience with galaxy watch 3",1

The past couple of weeks, my Galaxy Watch4 (SM-R870) has not been accurately tracking the amount of time I've actually been sleeping. 

In hopes it would improve the accuracy, I started activating Sleep Mode when I go to bed, to no avail. I also confirm that my watch is not loose in order to ensure accurate data measurements.

The best example I can give is from last night:
9:30 PM - Laid down in bed and activated Sleep Mode
10:00 PM - I'm asleep
5:50 AM - Wake up (naturally) before my 6:00 AM Alarm

I slept approximately 8 hours.

My watch indicates I slept from 1:20 - 5:50 AM... a total of 4.5 hours.

It's difficult to believe a company like Samsung can't match the likes of Huawei or even Apple on that, but it is what it is. But here's a solution I found for that.

For me, I like to use the watch for NFC payments, notifications and other goodies the watch does provide though. But I'd really like to know when I actually fall asleep for instance (the Huawei GT 3 does that beautifully and incredibly accurate), and of course, REM, light, deep sleep due to my medical condition (a good sleep is really important for me to track) but, the Huawei watch doesn't do NFC payment in my region. Bummer! The GW4 does it and I use it a lot! For that I love my GW4 Classic. But for the fitness/health tracking, we can always wear a RING! That's right! üòÅ Oura Ring, for one I've seen, does all the tracking for health and fitness incredibly well. So I'm considering getting one of those for that - it's absolutely less intrusive when in sleep than wearing a big 46mm watch, and it'll do far better than the watch has been trying to do for years. For everything else the watch will do!

 It's sad to look for an alternative out there for something that we're already paying for - this watch is supposed to do that, but if you're like me that won't use an iPhone, I think that can be an even better deal.

I hoped an official solution would come out, but I don't think an official app is coming and got sick of waiting, so I looked into it more today; I now have a working version of fb messenger on my Galaxy Watch 4. Though you can find other posts about this if you look around, I didn't find a post dedicated to it, so I thought I'd share here.

This is done with a process called ""sideloading."" This just means we're manually installing APKs that aren't available in the Play Store.

[Initial setup](https://www.droidwin.com/how-to-install-facebook-in-galaxy-watch-4/). Do all of Step 1 and skip the first part of Step 2 for now, i.e., do all of Step 2 except for 2.1. The key here is to enable debugging mode on your watch and install [Easy Fire Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.agondev.easyfiretools&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) on your phone.

Next, we need a version of facebook messenger that isn't problematic, i.e., the field to type messages is clickable. Through a combination of trial &amp; error and suggestions I saw on another post, I opted for [Version 18, nodpi](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/facebook-2/messenger-lite/messenger-lite-318-0-0-7-105-release/facebook-messenger-lite-318-0-0-7-105-6-android-apk-download/).

Now that you have Version 18 of Messenger Lite installed on your phone, go back to Step 2 and use that in place of the Facebook Lite APK file.

After waiting for the install to finish (be careful not to touch other areas of the screen during installation or it will cancel), open your watch and check that it's there.

559,"**Use case:** On my phone I use a pre-paid plan on an MVNO without eSIM support for Samsung Galaxy Watch. However I really wanted to have full LTE functionality (voice + data) on my watch. I finally figured out a \[relatively\] simple way to achieve that with one caveat: the watch will use a different number (so sometimes I have to use call forwarding when I leave my phone at home). Also this will only work in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step-by-step instruction**:

1. set-up an account at Tello (my referral link is at the bottom of the post - and thanks if you choose to use it!), configure your plan (mine is $7 per month) and buy the eSIM
2. on your phone go to Galaxy Wearable app and access hidden menu: tap  the ""3-stripe"" menu on the upper left -&gt; tap gear icon on the right -&gt; tap ""About Galaxy Wearable"" -&gt; tap quickly 5 times on the big title ""Galaxy Wearable""
3. in that menu tap ""Test ESIM Feature"", then turn ON the ""Current QR TestMode""
4. Go back to the main screen, tap ""Watch settings"" -&gt; ""Mobile plans"" -&gt; tap ""Use code"" and scan the QR code you got from Tello in step (1)
5. On your watch go to Settings -&gt; Connections -&gt; ""Mobile networks"" and ensure either ""Auto"" or ""Always on"" is chosen, then scroll down to the ""Mobile plans"" and switch ""Tello"" to ON

That's it!

585,"Wondering why I received this recommendation to reset my watch, I checked my phone. I discovered that the Galaxy Wearable App had reinstalled on the phone. That must have happened today as I earlier reordered the tiles through the Galaxy Wearable app. 

With the new installation of the Galaxy Wearable app, all watch setting on the on the phone are now gone. The phone cannot reconnect, although the watch is visible,  and the Galaxy Wearable app claims my watch is connected to another phone. I assume this ""another phone"" is the same phone but with a different installation of the Galaxy Wearable app. Samsung phone support believes ""your watch has connected to some other phone, perhaps your neighbor's..."" Right, how would that have happened?  I don't believe it for a second and there hasn't been any indication of such anywhere.

Meanwhile the watch is connected to Google Keep via LTE, which I tested by entering a new Google Keep note on the watch and it was viewable both on PC and phone very soon thereafter. The phone part of the LTE watch works, but none of messaging functions, 

I logged into the Samsung Account to check my watch status from my PC, and the Samsung site claims my watch has been disconnected since week, on the same day I installed Samsung Pay. I've been using the watch everyday, all Samsung apps have been working, such as Samsung Health which has been receiving all my activities until yesterday, I've paid with the watch, used public transport etc.

I would like to salvage my watch's settings because it took a lot of time and effort to get Google Assistant and Google Keep to work. The Google assistant is not available from the Play store when accessing from the phone and Samsung's support had to provide major support for a couple of hours to get it working. Now I don't want to lose it. The Samsung account does not show any back up of the watch whatsoever, albeit I thought this would be taken care of. The last Samsung support rep I had contact with told me there never is any back up made of the watch settings. That seems odd. Their representatives seem to have extremely varied experience from non-existent to very knowledgeable.

So, some questions:

1. Is there anyway to salvage my watch settings through activating developer settings and somehow make a back up of the watch settings to my PC? Or is the procedure to simply give up and reset the watch and look forward to major effort of trying to get the Google Assistant up and running again.
2. Is there a way to prevent this from happening again. I believe I had set the watch to only update manually, but it's running GWA3 whereas the last time I looked I believe it was running GVK1.
3. Galaxy Wearable was set to quite a lot of interventions and updating must have been on automatic. I will try to set this to only update manually in the future.
4. Samsung's rep could not tell me how my watch was changed from active to inactive in the Samsung Cloud settings. I find it extremely annoying because there has been no sign that this happened, no message on either phone or watch that this took place. So it could happen again, and I would only find out if I continuously log into the Samsung account and have a look. Any way to set up a message when there is a change in status for devices. BTW Samsung could not tell by why there is not ""reactivate"" function in the Samsung online account. The lack of information and knowledge is pretty scary.This afternoon I got a message on the LTE watch to reset it if I want to connect to the phone.

I would like some advice on which watch to buy. Ideally I would like it to support LTE (not that I'm going to use it at first, as my carrier doesn't support eSIM yet, but I suppose a watch with LTE can work as a Bluetooth device as well. Will LTE drain battery without setting it up or using it at all?

I read many comments and saw many videos, so I just really don't know if it is worth getting a  Galaxy watch 4 44mm LTE or a Galaxy watch 5 44mm LTE  (more expensive, around 90 EUR extra than watch 4). Some claim that  Galaxy watch 5 44mm has worse battery life than Galaxy watch 4 44mm, although I don't know if this is true or how it's possible, because watch 5 has a larger battery capacity than watch 4. I trust though the comments of this YouTuber, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj\_gCcq92GU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj_gCcq92GU) which he says he found out that watch 5 drains battery faster than watch 4 for the same settings. 

I'm not really a sporty person, so I'm going to use the watch mainly for notifications, replying to SMS, calling (1-2 calls per day maybe or none at all) and on demand heart rate and oxygen measurement, or NFC payment (turn it on only when I need it). Also I might use it to track my running or walking or sleeping once in a while. So Ideally I will have the Always on Display off and also raise/tilt to wake off, power saving mode on, and uninstall Google Assistant (I read it consumes a lot of battery). 

I am also thinking about Galaxy 5 Pro 45mm LTE because it has a really good battery but I don't like much it's design, and that bezel, which makes it difficult to put it under your shirt (could be wrong, as I haven't seen it in person), and also that it's much more expensive than watch 5 or watch 4. 

I am not sure how many days I can get from having those settings on each of these smartwatches. Definitely, Galaxy 5 Pro 45mm can go like a week with a single charge I believe.

I also have in mind, ticwatch E3 which is cheaper of all, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, and regarding battery I read that it can go 4-5 days with those settingsGalaxy watch 5 44mm or Galaxy watch 4 44mm",1

I just figured it was probably a contact sync bug and whatever. Finally played around today to narrow down what exactly was happening.


All contacts were in fact syncing between watch&lt;-&gt;phone, but if a contact is a *business* and does not have a ""first name"" ""last name"" field present, it will show up at the bottom of the watch Contacts app as just the number, and also in messages and calls as just the number.


Giving the contact a First/Last Name, will then makes the watch contact properly tag in messages/calls. The Samsung watch contacts app does not seem to have any settings to change any kind of behavior.


This isn't a solution, but a workaround, and thankfully an explanation for the errant behavior.


Hopefully Samsung fixes the way the WearOS watches handle contacts in a future update to list business name if the contact doesn't contain a First/Last Name field. Their Tizen watches do not seem to have this problem. The WearOS flavor feels very beta versus the Tizen ones. (Like why does the DnD widget in the Quick Panel not let you choose 1, 2, forever hours like it does in the Tizen OS version? Where did the barometric pressure graph go? etc.)


Does Samsung have any method for users to support bug tickets other than screaming into the void?

647,"... Probably.

I mean, I paid premium price for a GW4 and what I got is actually a pretty dumb watch. The pulse reading doesn't really work‚Äîit sometimes 50 bpm higher than my actual pulse as measured by a dedicated pulse monitor.  The inactivity monitor is just as stupid as it gets‚Äîtotally useless. Measuring my stress seems reasonably accurate, except I already know whether I'm stressed or not. BP measuring is disabled in the U.S. (not that it is that reliable in any case). I knew the EKG would not be very reliable, but I thought it would be better than nothing... well...

After a few months of use, these are the functions I use most consistently:

* Timers
* Notifications from my phone (calls, meetings, etc.). This is actually what's most useful. If a cheaper watch can show my notifications, that would seal the deal.
* Outside temperature
* Step counter
* Find my phone

At the beginning I used a bunch of functions that, once the novelty wore off, I no longer have any interest in. And some of the ones I'm interested in, don't work reliably as I mentioned in the beginning. 

Once, I asked Bixby to set a reminder for later in the evening and instead set an alarm for the next day too early in the morning and it didn't even let me know. After using several watch faces, will all degrees of beauty and customization, I'm back to a fairly basic one.

My GW4 Classic has not a superb battery life and everyone knows that.

No HR or sleep tracking/blood oxygen off too. With all that I've been gettin a good 2 days and a couple of hours more...

And for this test I disconnected the watch at 15% (2 days exactly on the battery menu). I went ahead and turned on HR continuous measure. It's charging now and I will use it in this cycle and will see how much exactly the continuous HR sensor will drain the battery.

Is there a quick-lock feature? Or a setting that will only lock if my watch is disconnected from my home wi-fi or phone? It would even help if the watch remembered my previously chosen passcode, so I could just toggle the ""Lock"" on or off.

9 times out of 10 this person isn't using their watch the same way you're using yours , they more than likely have a very minimal watch face with little to no complications. This is where their battery life comes from. If you're like me and have a more active watch face (showing weather, steps, HR, battery etc), with AOD and tilt to wake on as well as using most of the sensors including wifi and Bluetooth (the only thing I have turned off on my GW4 44mm is snore detection). You will probably get about 24 to 30 hours of battery life without charging throughout the day. The thing is, your watch face will probably always be your biggest battery drain, that doesn't mean that you should change your watch settings (turning off aod and tilt to wake) and use Endangered Animals, getting less functionality out of your watch for that 10 extra hours of battery life. You paid money for whatever watch you ended up getting, the people who are getting those 2 days are using their watch their way, it's not going to be the same way you use yours. If your battery life bothers you on your current settings, simply charge it during the day when you have a little free time. That way you can enjoy your watch completely 

I made this post because I feel a bit bad for the folk out there who find themselves comparing their watch battery to others. You should always enjoy your tech products your way even if it means  you have to charge it more than others :). I use all sensors on my watch, as well as using the infobrick watch face which I believe has 5 or 6 complications. I use my watch this way because I like to, it gets me the most functionality. The only thing I don't use is snore detection (I track sleep though) and hey Google.

Enjoy your watch your way, charge more if you have to, but don't make your watch less useful and less enjoyable for your particular use cases just because you are not getting the same battery life as someone who is using their watch with less functionality. At the end of the day, we all use our watches differently, as long as you're enjoying your watch your way, it's okay to not have as much battery life, charge your watch a bit more so that you can continue to enjoy it your way.

Recently I've bought Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra together with Samsung Galaxy Watch5 Pro LTE happy that finally I will have proper smartwatch. I took care of basic setup for new phone and tried to setup watch next. Apparently I'm unable to pair that watch to any phone (tried 3 different Android phones with no luck whatsoever).

On either phone it looks similar. Watch is recognized under Samsung Wearable but when I click it to pair after a while I get info that connection with watch was unsuccessful. Normally as I saw in the internet there suppose to be some kind of pair code/numbers that usually shows up when you pair bluetooth device.

Watch is production date of 15 January 2023 so I believe it may already have latest firmware installed (not exactly sure how to check that). Out of things that I already checked in the google and tried:

* Factory reset Watch using recovery menu (wipe data/cache)
* Factory reset of S23 (as this is new phone I could safely do that)
* Reinstall of Samsung Wearable and Watch5 plugin (also data delete of these apps)
* Giving all possible permissions to these apps
* Trying to pair using Samsung Health accessories as staring point
* Changing language on either device
* Network settings reset
* Making sure that BT is indeed on
* Try to pair while watch is in factory mode
* Try to downgrade Samsung Wearable to older app version (tried couple back until app started to self-upgrade)

I believe I tried to pair it at least 100 times using different approaches but nothing works... Maybe I'm missing something - that process should take 1 second when I use only Samsung hardware.

924,"I just got a Watch 4 classic off Amazon. It's the first smart watch I've ever had, so I'm just learning it all. Unfortunately, the Bluetooth on my watch keeps turning itself off and on very quickly around every 10 seconds. I've seen it in the settings go from on and off. It disconnects from my phone, too, so I'm constant notifications on my phone and watch about it. If I'm doing anything that requires the connection like the camera control, it'll say I need to reconnect. 

I've reset the watch countless times to see if that fixes it. Uninstalled the wearables app, clean cache, all the fixes I've seen posted online, and it's still doing this. 

Has anyone else seen this? Is there a fix, or should I be returning the watch?My Watch4 Classic keeps turning Bluetooth off and on by itself",1

I've seen some posts saying an update Samsung pushed out over the Winter has been causing this for many people, so it appears to be a common issue. However, the Samsung rep I chatted with said I could either trade it in or get it repaired for $200 (buying a new Watch 5 would be cheaper at that point).

927,"So it's actually a thing. Had it myself happen last night, whilst the watch was on charge. It did 75k steps!

OK, let's explain a little. I charge my watch on a small, USB fan. It has a metal cage, so rhe puck sticks to it. I use this to cool the watch and puck during charge and it does a really good job at keeping it cool. Can get from 0 to 100 in under two hours, and the usual 20ish% to 100 in just over an hour.

Thing is, dust had built up into the fan. So I cleaned it, soaked the spinning elements with WD40 and off it went at full, fluidic speed. Here lay the problem. Because the fan is spinning so fast, there is a vibration that is quite noticeable. The night after this clean and the first charge, I did 75k.

I believe, and this is a hypothesis here. A recent update to Samsung Health app is to blame. It has made the accelerometer more sensitive, thinking even the most subtle of vibrations are steps.

I have a Galaxy Watch 5 Pro with the latest updates. It consistently fails to record my heart rate and blood oxygen during sleep, although it's set to record the heart rate every 10 minutes and blood oxygen recording is enabled.

Watch is a 40mm WiFi only. Bought in early December 2022.

My new galaxy watch has become nearly unusable overnight.

Up until last Thursday, my watch would easily last from 7am until the following morning (~20% left), and would need a nice charge to 100 before work.

Thursday I noticed my S20 was many updates behind, and went through about 5 software updates back-to-back.

Around 4pm, my watch wants to go into power saving mode. Around 4:15, it's in watch-only mode at 5%, and at 4:25 it's dead. 

Now I am suddenly getting only about 6-8 hours of charge. It drops rapidly, to the point of making the watch useless. This morning I was at 92 percent when a meeting started at 9:30am, and was at 81 percent at 10:10am after the meeting.

I have made zero changes to the watch or anything. Zero changes, the only change was updating my phone. 

The only thing I am reading online for help is to start disabling almost every feature on the watch, which also makes the watch useless. 

Hoping someone has more advice than the typical ""turn off AoD"", ""make heart rate timer at 10 minutes"", ""turn off media controls"".  I have noticed that disabling Bluetooth (and severing connection to my phone) stabilizes the battery life.

1083,"With trade in on Samsung's site (trading in a refurbed gw3C, I assume the gw3C is accepted as it only offers a trade in check box for GW3) which places the price for both the gw5 44mm and gw5 pro within like 20 dollars of eachother.

On one hand battery life and extra durability sounds great, but right now my forerunner 255 is 14mm thick and with the gw5 pro coming in at 15mm thick I do not think I would enjoy having such a chunky lad on my wrist.  The sleeker design of the gw5 44mm looks appealing as well but I worry I will damage the watch easily without the titanium case and stronger glass. Will be purchasing care+ on either watch.

Does anyone have any thoughts?  As long as the battery life on the 44mm can go 1.5 days with relative consistency I'm not sure I'll care too much about the difference and the aesthetic/comfort benefits of the thinner/lighter 44mm has me conflicted as well as the relatively small price gap between the two assuming I don't get scuffed by Samsung during the trade in process.

1092,"When I go for a run, I use the watch's built-in workout feature for tracking, and the [Excercise Timer app](https://www.exercisetimer.net/watch) to keep track of my intervals (to switch between walking and running).

However, I've noticed that when I start the built-in workout first, and then start a workout in Excercise timer, the built-in workout is stopped. It seems to work fine the other way around. This surprised me because the built-in workout feature usually keeps running fine in the background when I use other apps.

Any ideas what might be causing this behavior? Is this something the Excercise Timer app might be doing, some WearOS-level ""start workout"" API call (if that even exists, just a wild guess) or something along those lines.

From what I can tell, it's unrelated to the apps running in the foreground or background, I can switch between them fine if I start them in the ""right order"" without one of them stopping.Built-in workout stops when starting one in Excercise Timer",1

So I have an interesting issue with the Heart rate monitor on my 5 Pro.

I see Samsung has released several firmware updates and how accurate is the HR/GPS during all of the above mentioned activities? Also read that I can use third party apps (Gear Tracker II, Ghost Racer etc) due to the inability of the Samsung native watch app to track activities accurately and not able to pair to external sensors. These third party apps can also pair to external sensors and has better HR/GPS accuracy is what I'm reading.

I followed all the possible solutions I have found, including putting only one google account and resetting multiple times.

Set the digital assistant app to None, and then opening assistant from the app list. For some reason it decided to connect this time and set itself up.

I am wondering if this is a good opportunity or if the 4 will be fading out and I should hold out. I mostly want it for reminders, lists, health/sleep tracking and podcasts. Any advice is appreciated!Contemplating a GW4",1

1198,"I've had my Galaxy Watch5 44mm for little over a month now. The reviews on Reddit and elsewhere seemed to be mostly positive but I'm blown away by the poor performance almost across the board. Fitness/sleep/health tracking, responsiveness and battery life are all substantially worse than expected. 

\- Battery life is well under 24h from day one unless most features are disabled, including things I'd consider ""base functionality"" like continuous heartrate monitoring.

\- Touch screen has a noticeable latency from day one, especially when trying to cycle between screens. The face completely freezes for a second or so if I try to cycle through them quickly.

\- Sleep tracking quality is very poor. Sleep is also often arbitrarily separated into many smaller ""naps"", each with poor sleep scores, that can't be combined, making the metrics useless (afaik at least, the edit feature doesn't let me do anything in my Samsung Health App). 

\- Blood oxygen measurement doesn't seem very accurate at all.

\- Fitness and heartrate tracking is mediocre at best. Substantially worse than my 6 year old FitBit which measured continuously and lasted well over a week on a single charge for years. This one seems to lose the ability to measure anything accurately once you start moving or sweating at all.

\- Advanced features such as ECG and body composition take 30 seconds to measure, but fail most of the time requiring many attempts and several minutes to get a reading.

\- As a final FU to the customer, the charger requires an uncommon adapter that is not included with the watch. Really enjoyed not being able to use this until the stores reopened after Christmas. 

I'm really at a loss here. Are there some tips/settings I'm not aware of that will make this thing functional? Did I get a dud? Is health tracking more of an afterthought for most buyers and not heavily factored into reviews? How much worse should I expect the battery life and performance/latency to get with age?Very Disappointed with my Galaxy Watch5. What am I missing?",1

1261,"I thought I might share something I discovered recently after a few months of frustration with both problems.  I noticed that my Watch 5 44mm non-LTE would sometimes last for two plus days between charges but sometimes run down in less than a day.  Battery consumption was incredibly inconsistent,  losing only 1-2%% per hour then draining 10% in 30 minutes without any change in usage.  I've also been having trouble with my Galaxy S22 video and audio sporadically stuttering across multiple apps.

&amp;#x200B;

Two entirely separate problems that are both well documented among users right?  Turns out, at least in my case, they were linked.  I noticed that sometimes when I tried to change the media volume on my phone, instead of increasing or decreasing by one notch per click, it would change unpredictably, increasing a few notches then decreasing a few notches on a single button press as if a child were playing with a volume dial.  Eventually I noticed that this volume behavior was linked to the video stuttering.  Originally I would have to reboot my phone to fix the problem but I eventually determined that toggling airplane mode also solved the issue and eventually narrowed it down to toggling the bluetooth.  Toggling the bluetooth got me thinking so the next time I noticed that the Watch 5 battery was draining rapidly, I checked my phone and the erratic volume along with video stuttering was present.  Toggled the bluetooth on the phone and everything, including batter consumption went back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this doesn't solve the problem entirely but with a little extra awareness, this has turned a problem that nearly had me return the watch into something that is manageable with minor annoyance.  Additionally, if Samsung happens to check this sub, maybe this information can help them resolve the battery drain issue many of us are seeing.  I reported this to Samsung via their website but have no idea if it will get to the right people or if it vanishes into the void.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you've been having either, or both, of these problems and none of the fixes from other Googled threads are working, try toggling the bluetooth and see if it helps.A Tale of Two Problems - Watch 5 battery drain and S22 video stuttering",1

1263," In the last a couple of weeks, the information shown on the workout screens on Samsung Health App becomes less and less on my watch 5. Initially, the Walking workout started showing less information, now the running behaves the¬†same. Attached are the two screens shown on watch for running. You can see only duration and Pace/heart rate information are displayed. Where is the number such as max pace, distance, steps, etc?¬† Even worse, if I choose walk workout, then only duration is repeatedly (4 times) shown on the screen on watch. One thing I want to mention is the correct information is still shown in the health app on my Samsung phone once I connect the watch to the phone, but the watch doesn't show the missing information. This is a big problem, as I don't take watch while running and I totally rely on the information shown on the watch to adjust my activity.

From conducting lots of research in the smartwatch space, a common theme I found was people wanting to share their activity and goals with friends who own a different smart watch brand.

Everyone also receives their very own avatar who can be levelled up through hitting your goal each week (no pay to win).

With YTM, when I add new songs to playlist on phone, the downloaded playlist doesn't seem to update on watch. Within few days I had YTM opened on watch and phone, both connected on Wifi, and songs just weren't added. When I deleted the playlist from watch, and downloaded it again, all the new songs were there, so does YTM just lack the playlist update feature, or is it buggy for me?

I have measured my pulse rate by hand (i.e. putting a finger on my vein and counting it), and I can surely say that 175 is the closer number, it is definitely not 135. 

As far as I can tell, this is very random, I don't think I can reproduce it on purpose. Is this a bug encountered by others as well?

(Also, this is probably unlikely, but I have a hunch): This almost seems like a (Nyquist) sampling problem! If I finish my exercise, I obviously expect my heart rate to drop. BUT, it actually rises! This sounds as if the tracker cannot correctly sample 175-180, and is erratically reporting it as 130; but when my heart rate drops, it now gets back into the ""acceptable"" range, and hence the watch suddenly starts reporting it correctly.GW4: Erratic pulse rate on random days",1

I don't have any experience with wearables but wanted to know what metrics can they track that can give insight into possible cardiac irregularities.

So far what I've gleaned from couple of weeks of research:

Apple watch:
1. Super accurate heart rate tracking (great, but others aren't terrible either)
2. Does not monitor heart rate constantly unless it detects a workout (deal-breaker for this particular usecase since you'd want continuous monitoring to spot an intermittent issue?)
3. Irregular rhythm monitoring is not continuous, rather it does spot checks (also a deal breaker?)


Fitbit sense 2 and charge 5:
Constant HR monitoring and irregular rhythm as well? They fail as smart watches but better for health tracking?

Samsung watch 5:

1. No irregular rhythm monitoring
2. Constant HR monitoring

1379,"Lately I have been experiencing a really odd problem with my GW4 Classic LTE and I have not seen anything like it online. Basically, if I have it connected to my phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra) via Bluetooth, randomly all the audio that comes out of my phone will sound choppy/breaking. Volume control will only update during the split second there is audio playing. This will happen regardless of whether the audio is outputting to the phone's speaker or to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds. 

Although I managed to narrow down the issue to the watch connection, I do not know exactly what is causing it because disconnecting and reconnecting the watch will temporarily solve the audio problems until the audio decides on being choppy again with no obvious trigger. The only workaround I have found is to disable ""calls"" toggle under the phone's Bluetooth settings. This will keep my watch connected and still display notifications, but I will not be able to take Bluetooth calls with the watch anymore, which I don't want.

Something funny I noticed: if I start find my phone while the audio is choppy it will temporarily fix the audio on my phone for about 5 seconds before going back to playing like a scratched-up CD.

My galaxy watch has a plan through verizon it is set to be always on instead of auto. I still cannot use the watch without my phone being on or connected to Bluetooth. I have talked to verizon and samsung and they said they have no answers.

It says "" phone is online switch to phone inbox"" I click dismiss and it just takes me back to the switch to phone inbox screen. So, I tried to use Samsung messages and it gives my watch a completely different number. 

Things i have tried:

I'm considering purchasing the galaxy watch4 since it is less expensive than the galaxy watch5, and let's be honest - I do not see any differences between them except in the color availability and the wireless charging, which isn't a big issue for me.

In my home country: Watch5 is 590$

Watch4 is 240$ a 300$ less expensive than watch5, and the green band is ''amazing.''

Classic watch4 is 256$.

* Not erasing it properly which leaves my data recoverable to somebody who knows how to dig it up.

1574,"Since there are lots of ppl having difficulty with their watch not showing in WFS, i'd like to share with you my experience of getting it to work using the adb wifi method. Hope it helps  
Step-by-step guide:  
1. Make sure to have both your watch and pc connected to the same wifi network  
2. (on your watch) enable developer options -&gt; turn on adb debugging -&gt; turn on debug over wifi, wait for a few seconds  
3. (on your watch) you'll see your ip address in the form of 192.168.xxx.xxx under the debug over wifi option, write it down, put the watch aside unlocked   
4. (on your pc) [Download the Android SDK Platform Tools ZIP file for Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip), extract it  (I've had toubles with the Minimal ADB and Fastboot, so i'd suggest using this one instead)  
5. (on your pc) launch cmd, enter the following 2 command lines one by one  
  
cd C:\\Users\\xxx\\Downloads\\platform-tools  
(this should be the default location of the adb platform tools where xxx is your username)  
  
adb connect 192.168.xxx.xxx  
(replace the x's with your ip address copied from your watch)  
  
6. Confirm the adb prompt showing on your watch (i'd go for the *always allow* so you won't have to repeat the step again)  
  
normally you will see *connected to 192.168.xxx.xxx* right after entering the second command and confirming adb on your watch

1575,"I've had my Galaxy Watch 4 for over a month now, and I really hate the sleep tracker on it.

I'd been using Fitbit trackers for years prior to this, and never had any troubles with them.

With the Samsung Health app, it very frequently fails to recognize when I'm actually asleep ‚Äì especially when it comes to napping, which I do frequently due to certain health conditions.

Like, I can take an hour long nap at 2 pm and it won't even recognize it!

On top of that, it doesn't really give me a good idea of how much I've actually slept ‚Äì which is the most important feature for me.  It'll say something like ""you slept 6 hours and 42 minutes last night,"" on my actual watch, but when I go into the app on my phone, I'll find that the ACTUAL time I was asleep was really only 4 hours and 28 minutes.

I have no idea why it wouldn't just tell me the actual amount of time I was asleep from the start??

That, on top of the fact that it rarely doesn't detect my naps (even 3-4 hours in the middle of the day frequently won't be counted ‚Äì as if it simply can't comprehend the concept of sleeping any other time but night!), just makes this thing nearly useless for me.

I don't need anything fancy, like blood oxygen, snoring, or even stages of sleep I could pass on (though they're appreciated).  I just want a reliable app that will tell me when I was asleep and when I was not.  That's it.

So this evening I lost my phone in the kitchen, but I didn't know at the time it was exactly that room. 

So that's an easy fix right? Just your watch to ring it.
Except I was in a different room and by then my phone and watch disconnected, but even if I was in the kitchen and it says connected, it didn't ring for some reason.

So then I tried Google assistant as it only needs an Internet connection for the watch and then it just rings your phone.

But here comes the real issue, I was connected to the WiFi as the watch itself, but Google assistant keeps demanding an Internet connection to work. I even tried both 5ghz and 2.4ghz. So IDK if it was Google's fault or the watch's fault, but it's certainly not the Internet connection because I see my mom watching Netflix and my cousin playing an online game

So eventually I just stopped being a lazy bum and use the old fashion method of actually finding it myself.

TLDR: Watch easily disconnects from the phone, and sometimes doesn't ring despite being connected.

1598,"So I recently upgraded from first-gen GW to GW5pro. The old, Tizen-based GW still worked fine, but I imagined that jumping from gen 1 to gen 5 would be a huge difference (in reality it's pretty modest, although it was still worth it). Better sleep tracking was one of the things that I wanted the most, because occasionally I'm suffering from insomnia; it's an intermittent issue and I'm trying to get a better understanding of how my body rests and what I can do to ensure good sleep. GW1 was pretty inaccurate and often recorded about 10 minutes of deep sleep per night, which I blamed on outdated sensors. GW5 has more and better sensors for sleep tracking, and, indeed, it reports between 40 to 75 minutes of deep sleep on most nights, which sounds more reasonable.

A couple of nights ago I was finally hit with insomnia and spent a sleepless night. In the morning looked at my watch: sleep score 70/100, even though ""actual sleep time"" was only 4.5 hours. I'm not quite sure where this ""actual sleep time"" comes from, probably from the periods when I was lying still and trying to fall asleep. But reported 40 minutes of deep sleep is absolutely unrealistic.

[the night of bad sleep](https://preview.redd.it/zimn5xobjyba1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa7a3f64ca1bf6532387bded73f645ab3801c285)

Last night my sleep was much better, I had a chance to recover after the sleepless night and rest properly. GW, however, registered many short periods of being awake, decided that I was oversleeping (total sleep time 10 hrs 40 min, actual sleep time 9 hrs 36 min), and rated my sleep 51/100. Heck, I know that I was sleeping well, I feel the effects of good night's sleep in my body, but the bloody tracker on my wrist seriously thinks that the previous night was 20% better. WTF?

One of the obvious flaws is that Samsung Health app decides whether you had enough, not enough, or too much sleep based on total sleep time, not actual sleep time. But I can also sense the issues with the sensors (pun intended) and algorithms that detect various stages of sleep. Last but not least, the ""sleep score"" calculated by Samsung is a joke and I can't take it seriously.Opinion: GW sleep tracking is trash",1

My watch is collecting all kinds of scarcthes on the case and there's even silver showing through on the bezel after a couple days of use while kept under a hoodie sleeve and never banged on anything (I would have known and checked it). Some of these you can even barely kinda feel with your nail (on the Ti). I don't think anything should have done this to the watch as far as my use is concerned.That being said, after a year of use I bet this thing will be pretty uniformly scuffed and develop a rugged brushed ti look which I'm all for, this is also Ti and can be very easily finished.

I noticed recently that sometimes my watch will enter a state where it drains about 30% of battery per hour. I've checked in Battery Historian and the leak seems to be caused to ImsService acquiring a constant wake lock.

Reading about it a bit, ImsService is related to VoLTE, RCS and similar 4G services. I've since set the watch to 3G only mode, and haven't noticed the battery leak since. If you want to keep mobile data on (which seems to require 4G to be on), you can also turn off VoLTE using adb:

1759,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit but I need help from you. I deciding between these two watches and right at the start I have to say that my last Wear OS watches was TicWatch E from 2017 that lasted me fo 3 years. Admittedly their battery life was awful and they died after 3 years because AMOLED display completely burned down. So in case of that and year long pause from any wearable (occasionally MiBand 3) I want to buy a new device. TicWatch E has 1.4"" inch (44mm) display so I thought that that would be my first spec that I want, although Wear OS. Other spec's like NFC connectivity is on the table. LTE isn't that important so basic WiFi model is suitable. But with all battery related problems that I had with TicWatch E I'm really cautious about Galaxy Watch 4 and their battery life. I know that differences between 4 and 5 are almost none, Beside Gorilla glass at 4 and Sapphire Cristal at 5 with somewhere around 15% more battery life and fast charging.
So it's tough for me to decide and Reddit really helped me a lot in a past so here I am again.
Thanks for you help.

This week, I tried using the built-in app instead of Strava to see if I would get a different result, but the same thing happened. 

I do not have a metal band, so that shouldn't affect gps accuracy. The watch is brand new, only a couple of weeks old. It also has LTE connectivity which is enabled.

I've upgraded my 2y old GWA2 44mm to GW4. I've ordered 44mm but I got 40mm. I've decided to give it a try. My wrist is 17cm.

## How to Change the band of the Gear s3 Frontier

There are several ways to change the band on the Gear S3 Frontier, it can get though especially for people who haven‚Äôt changed a watch band before or are new to Samsung watches, So here are tips to changing the Samsung gear s3 frontier watch band.

1. **Quick Release Pins**: The Gear S3 Frontier comes with quick release pins on the back of the watch that allow you to easily remove and attach the band. Simply push the pin in and the band will come off. To attach a new band, align the holes on the band with the pins and push the pins through.
2. **Screwdriver**: If the quick release pins are not working or you don‚Äôt have them, you can use a small screwdriver to remove the screws on the back of the watch that hold the band in place. Be careful not to strip the screws or damage the watch.
3. **Band Replacement Tool**: Samsung sells a band replacement tool specifically designed for the Gear S3 Frontier that makes it easier to remove and attach the band. The tool has a fork-like end that fits over the pins and a handle that you can use to push the pins in or pull them out.
4. **Take it to a Professional**: If you are not comfortable attempting to change the band on your own, you can take it to a professional watch repair shop. They should be able to change the band for you.
5. **Third-Party Adapter**: Some third-party companies make adapters that allow you to use any standard 22mm watch band with your Gear S3 Frontier. These adapters attach to the back of the watch and provide holes for the quick release pins or screws to go through.
6. **Spring Bar Tool**: A spring bar tool is a specialized tool that is used to remove and attach watch bands. It has two pointed ends that can be used to push in or pull out the spring bars that hold the band in place.
7. **Use the Original Band**: If you want to change the band but don‚Äôt want to purchase a new one, you can try using the original band that came with the watch. The band may be hidden behind the watch face and can be removed by gently prying it off with a thin tool such as a small flathead screwdriver or a butter knife.   
 

 

1. **A review of the different types of bands available for the Gear S3 Frontier and their pros and cons.**

There are several types of bands available for the Gear S3 Frontier, each with their own set of pros and cons. Here is a review of some of the most common types of bands:

 

**1. Leather**: Leather bands are classic and stylish, and they can dress up or dress down the look of your Gear S3 Frontier. They are also comfortable to wear and can conform to the shape of your wrist over time. However, leather bands are not as durable as some other materials and may require more maintenance to keep them looking good. They may also be less suitable for activities that involve sweating or getting the band wet.

**Price**: **$16.89**

 

**2. Stainless Steel**: Stainless steel bands are strong, durable, and resistant to wear and tear. They are also water resistant and can withstand exposure to moisture. Stainless steel bands tend to be more expensive than other types of bands and can be heavy to wear. They may also be less comfortable than bands made of softer materials.

**Price: $17.99**

 

**3. Silicone**: Silicone bands are a popular choice for sports and other physical activities because they are lightweight, flexible, and sweat resistant. They are also inexpensive and easy to clean. However, silicone bands may not be as stylish as other types of bands and may not be suitable for formal occasions.

**Price: $4.99**

 

**4. Nylon**: Nylon bands are strong, durable, and resistant to wear and tear. They are also lightweight and comfortable to wear. Nylon bands are often used in sports and outdoor activities and are available in a variety of colors and patterns. However, nylon bands may not be as stylish as some other types of bands and may not be suitable for formal occasions.

**Price: $15.39**

 

**5. Canvas band**: canvas bands are a popular choice for the Gear S3 Frontier because they are stylish, comfortable, and durable. They are made of a strong, woven fabric that is resistant to wear and tear and can withstand exposure to moisture. Canvas bands are also lightweight and flexible, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. They are available in a wide range of colors and patterns, so you can choose a band that matches your personal style.

**Price: $13.98**

 

It‚Äôs worth noting that the Gear S3 Frontier is also compatible with standard 22mm watch bands, so you have a wide range of options to choose from. You can find bands made of materials such as rubber, plastic, and even fabric. Just make sure that the band you choose is compatible with the quick release pins or screws on the back of the watch.

 

## Tips for choosing the right band for your Gear S3 Frontier based on your personal style and needs.

There are a few factors to consider when choosing the right band for your Gear S3 Frontier:

1. **Material**: Consider the material of the band, as this will affect the look, feel, and durability of the band. Options include leather, silicone, metal, and more.
2. **Fit:** Make sure the band is a comfortable fit for your wrist. It should be snug, but not too tight.
3. **Style:** Choose a band that matches your personal style. Do you prefer a more classic, timeless look or something more modern and trendy?
4. **Needs:** Think about your daily activities and what kind of band would be most suitable for your needs. For example, if you are active and frequently participate in sports, a silicone band may be a good choice because it is more sweat-resistant.
5. **Price:** Determine your budget and look for bands that fit within it. Keep in mind that higher-quality bands may cost more, but they may also be more durable and last longer.
6. **Compatibility:** Make sure the band is compatible with your Gear S3 Frontier. Some bands are designed specifically for the Gear S3, while others may be compatible with other models or brands of smartwatches.

¬†The right band for you will depend on your personal style, needs, and budget. Consider these factors and take the time to try on and compare different bands to find the one that is best for you.

## Ideas for dressing up or dressing down the Gear S3 Frontier with different bands.

There are several ways you can dress up or dress down your Gear S3 Frontier with different bands:

1. If you want to dress up your Gear S3 Frontier, you can choose a band made of materials like leather or stainless steel. These bands tend to be more expensive and give the watch a more formal, sophisticated look.
2. If you want to dress down your Gear S3 Frontier, you can choose a band made of materials like silicone or rubber. These bands are more casual and sporty and are great for everyday wear.
3. You can also choose a band with a unique pattern or design to add some personality and style to your watch. There are many options available, including bands with floral, animal, or abstract patterns.
4. Another option is to switch out the band for a different color. Choosing a band in a bold, bright color can add a pop of interest to your watch.
5. If you want to switch up your look frequently, you can even invest in multiple bands and switch them out depending on the occasion or your outfit.

## A comparison of third-party bands vs. official Samsung bands.

Lets, say you are comparing a samsung watch or the bands actually and you are stuck with making a decision on which one to choose or buy,¬†

Here are some points to consider when comparing third-party bands to official Samsung bands:

1. **Compatibility**: Make sure that the third-party band is compatible with your Samsung watch. Not all third-party bands will fit all models of Samsung watches.
2. **Quality**: Official Samsung bands are likely to be of higher quality and have a more premium feel compared to third-party bands. However, this is not always the case and you may be able to find third-party bands that are just as high quality as official bands.
3. **Price**: Third-party bands may be less expensive than official Samsung bands. However, you may be sacrificing quality and durability for a lower price.
4. **Availability**: Official Samsung bands may be more widely available and easier to find, especially if you need a replacement band for your watch.
5. **Warranty**: Official Samsung bands may come with a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty, while third-party bands may not. If the band fails or breaks, you may have to purchase a new one if it is not covered under a warranty.

Ultimately, the choice between an official Samsung band and a third-party band will depend on your individual needs and preferences. It may be worth considering a third-party band if you are looking for a lower price and don‚Äôt mind sacrificing some quality and availability. However, if you want the peace of mind that comes with a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty and higher quality materials, an official **Samsung band** definetly¬† is the better choice.

## How to care for and maintain different types of bands.

There are many different types of bands, each with its own unique set of care and maintenance needs. Here are a few general tips for caring for and maintaining different types of bands:

1. **Leather bands**: Leather bands should be kept clean and dry. Avoid getting them wet or exposing them to extreme heat. If the band gets dirty, you can gently wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If it gets really dirty, you can use a mild soap and water to clean it, but be sure to let it dry completely before wearing it again. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the leather.
2. **Metal or stainless steel bands**: Metal bands should be kept clean and dry. Avoid getting them wet or exposing them to extreme heat. If the band gets dirty, you can gently wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If it gets really dirty, you can use a mild soap and water to clean it, but be sure to let it dry completely before wearing it again. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the metal.
3. **Rubber or silicone bands**: Rubber or silicone bands are generally very easy to care for. Simply wash them with soap and water to keep them clean. Avoid exposing them to extreme heat or UV light, as this can cause them to become brittle or fade.
4. **Fabric or nylon bands**: Fabric or nylon bands should be kept clean and dry. Avoid getting them wet or exposing them to extreme heat. If the band gets dirty, you can gently spot clean it with a soft, dry cloth or a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the fabric.
5. **Wood or bamboo bands**: Wood or bamboo bands should be kept clean and dry. Avoid getting them wet or exposing them to extreme heat. If the band gets dirty, you can gently wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If it gets really dirty, you can use a mild soap and water to clean it, but be sure to let it dry completely before wearing it again. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, as they can damage the wood.

**The key to caring for and maintaining any type of band is to handle it gently, keep it clean and dry, and avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or harsh chemicals.**

The thing is though, it's not necessarily bad battery life, it's completely unpredictable battery life. When I got the watch at the start of December I was just about getting from 9am to 9:30pm before needing to charge so I could track sleep. I adjusted some settings &amp; then I didn't need to charge til the next morning (with bedtime mode on overnight)

Then it got inexplicably worse again, so I cleared the cache, watched many videos about battery life &amp; turned off everything I don't need. It was much improved, mostly getting me through a day &amp; night, but some days seem a lot worse than others, with pretty much no interactions. The screenshot is taken from today, all I've done is set a timer once &amp; looked at my steps when it reminded me to move. No apps are left open.

I am curious if there is a way to display this banner on a watch face? 
The use case is 
I want to view my blood sugar level on my watch face.
So that I do not have to check my phone or insulin pump every time I do so. 

Medtronic do not have a watch app, nor do they allow me to use the api that sends uploads the blood sugar level.

Had a hard time shutting it down but finally shut it down, sealed in a container filled with silica gel for an hour or two. Opened it and found rusted screws. No other clues of water damage.

After removing the main unit (battery and stuff) the back of the display had some moisture.

Emphasizing moisture it was really small, so is there any way I could dry this up and clean it? Hopefully it works somehow?

Have done a bit of repair on macs, phones, and some pieces of tech so I have a bit of tools.

The specs for some products are also hard to find, especially because amazon is full of useles clones.

1993,"Hello. I've got the Galaxy Watch 4 for Christmas. And it's been amazing in all ways except one. 

From the very beginning my watch would not show any notifications until I restarted my phone. I googled the potential solutions and they said to either restart the watch, restart the phone, do both or do a hard reset of the watch. I tried all of that and the problem persists. 

I did the hard reset just yesterday, and until that day the notifications were showing unless my phone was connected. As soon as I went a few rooms away from the phone and it disconnected - the notifications would stop. All the other functions worked properly and the notifications could be restored by restarting my phone. 
Now after the hard reset - the notifications stop even without disconnecting from the phone. They just stop appearing after a while. 

My smartwatch is up to date, the notifications on my phone are turned on, and my phone is POCO x3.

Any help?Notifications keep dissapearing",1
1994,"Hi all,

I got my mum a Galaxy Watch 5 LTE 40mm, and the battery life is about 21 hours from full charge, which is much less than I expected (reviews saying Samsung claims up to 50 hours).  She's had the watch for several weeks now, so this isn't a first-use battery improvement type thing.

I got the watch for her to use for fall detection and SOS alerting, so she is not a heavy user of the watch in other respects.  These are the optimisations/configurations I've applied to the watch, some of which I have taken from [the battery optimisation guide on the samsung website](https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/increase-battery-life-on-galaxy-watch/):
* Software fully up to date
* Heart rate tracking every 10 mins while still
* Stress tracking manual only
* Connections: bluetooth on, LTE on, wifi off, NFC off
* AOD off
* Voice wakeup off for bixby &amp; google assistant
* Notifications are disabled for everything except phone calls.  Screen does not turn on for notifications.
* Power saving mode is enabled.
* Location enabled

I spoke to Samsung support and the support rep told me the 44mm watch with its larger battery can only get up to 24 hours battery life.  I doubt this because of the reviews I've read but the Samsung website doesn't actually provide any comment (that I can find) on battery duration.

Can anyone with a similar configuration tell me what kind of battery life they get, or provide any other battery optimisation suggestions (keeping in mind that I do want things like LTE and location so it can be effectively used as a SOS/fall detection device) Thanks!Battery drain on Galaxy Watch 5 LTE 40mm",1
